\chapter{\\VARIABLES INFLUENCING RETROTRANSPOSON DISTRIBUTION IN GENES}

Retrotransposons (RTs) comprise approximately half of the human genome and contribute to chromatin structure, regulatory motifs, and protein-coding sequences. Upon insertion, RTs can disrupt functional genetic elements as well as introduce new sequence motifs to a region. They therefore have the potential to effect the function of genes in which they insert. It is hypothesized that the phenotypic impact of RTs on genes is a contributing factor to the non-random distribution of RTs across the genome. An example of this non-random distribution is antisense bias (AS bias) of elements within genes (chapter 2).  Although some of the variables associated with non-random distributions of RTs are understood, many variables remain unstudied. Specifically, there are many variables that have the potential to impact gene expression that have not been analyzed in association with RT distribution.

The detailed characterization of these associations is important to understand the impact of RTs within differing genomic locations. Determining which variables are most associated with decreases in RT distribution could help inform predictions of the severity of phenotypic consequence of \textit{de novo} as well as polymorphic RT insertions. The thousands of RT polymorphisms that are present between any two individuals \cite{Stewart2011} could then be filtered in a manner akin to the filitering of current SNP studies. RT distribution analyses would therefore, inform future disease studies attempting to associate genetic variability with disease phenotypes. Variables that are associated with the RT (e.g. length of element, orientation, sequence) as well as variables that are associated with the gene (e.g. tissue expression, density of coding sequence) will be examined in this section.  


%ASbias (Linear Decay)
\section{The Current Distribution of Alu and L1 within Genes}
%Linear Decay
The dependency of AS bias on position within a gene was calculated for both Alu and L1, where position was defined as one of ten deciles of a gene. RefSeq genes were divided into these deciles using the boundaries of transcription start site (TSS) and transcription stop site, including introns (figure \ref{fig:decile}). Previous research had used distance from the TSS to examine RT density, this alternative approach of normalizating genes by length expanded the scope of the analysis to examine the effect of relative position on RT density, and therefore the ability to detect any regions of the gene that were more sensitive to RT insertions. A side-effect of normalizing by the TSS and transcription stop positions was that every decile 1 (first decile) and decile 10 (last decile) necessarily contained an exon. Since deciles 2 - 9 (internal deciles) were not defined by any discrete exon boundary, they were variable with respect to the presence of an exon. For this reason many analyses were restricted to the internal deciles. It must be noted that although the first and last deciles inevitably contained an exon, it was not necessarily a coding exon (i.e.: 5\rq-UTR or 3\rq-UTR only). 

    %Figure Decile Explanation

Deciles were calculated from transcription start to transcription stop site from the RefSeq annotated genes.}}
    \label{fig:decile}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsection{L1 and Alu Antisense bias exhibits a linear decay across gene deciles}
\label{sec:as_dec}
RTs are increased in number near TSSs compared to transcription stop sites. It was first important to determine if examining RT distribution, while normalizing genes by length, replicated these findings. AS and S RTs were counted within each decile across all RefSeq genes and normalized by the total number of  RTs in all deciles (AS + S) for both Alu and L1.

\subsubsection{\textit{Alu}}
AS and S Alu were counted in each decile and normalized by the total number of Alu within all deciles (figure \ref{fig:lineardecay_alu}). Replicating previous findings, there was an increase in elements near the TSS (decile 1) compared to the end of the gene. Also as expected due to the known AS-bias, there were more AS Alu than S Alu overall. Alu in the S orientation were distributed relatively equally across the internal deciles with drops in density in deciles 1 and 10. Conversely, AS Alu exhibited a linear decay in distribution from decile 2 to decile 9. Similarly to Alu on the S strand, AS Alu also showed decreased in density, outside of the linear decrease, in deciles 1 and 10.

    \label{fig:lineardecay_alu}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsubsection{\textit{L1}}
L1 had a similar distribution to Alu when within genes. Again, as expected due to the overall AS bias, there was an increase in AS L1 compared to S L1. Throughout the internal deciles (2 - 9), S L1 remained at a relatively constant distribution, though it must be noted that there was more variability between these deciles, than observed with Alu. AS L1 exhibited a linear decile across the internal deciles (figure \ref{fig:lineardecay_l1}). The overall difference between AS L1 and S L1 within each decile, was larger than what was observed in Alu. This was emphasized by AS and S elements having reached a point of equal density in the last inner decile for Alu, while AS L1 remain more prevalent than S in every decile. \\

    \label{fig:lineardecay_l1}
    \end{figure}
   
\subsubsection{\textit{Linear Decay of Alu and L1}}
Both AS L1 and Alu began at a relatively high frequency in decile 2 and declined linearly until decile 9. The rate of AS decay across gene deciles was determined by analysing these internal deciles only. This avoided the confounding effects from the process of normalization. Slopes were calculated with the counts of raw elements as opposed to the proportions to facilitate interpretation (table \ref{table:lindecay}). As expected, the decile number had a significant impact on AS density in both Alu and L1, with Alu reduced by -994 elements per decile and L1 by -1410 elements per decile. S elements were not significantly effected by the decile within which they resided.

    \end{table}

Previous research suggested that RTs increased in a peak around the TSS. The results presented here using normalized gene lengths revealed that RTs are not only increased in density near the TSS, but are increased as a function of the normalized distance from the TSS. Moreover, the enrichment of elements is restricted to AS elements. If the increase near the TSS was purely due to a structural change in accessiblity, it would be expected that both AS and S elements would be increased near the TSS. Therefore, these results indicated that there may be a functional link between the orientation of elements and the propensity to which they are maintained within genes. Futhermore, there is a difference in this propensity near the TSS as opposed to near the 3\rq -end of a gene. 


%%Change of Linear Decay Over Time
%\subsection{Linear Decay Develops Over Time}
%AS bias in general was shown to increase relatively quickly for Alu, but to change over long periods of evolutionary time in L1. The slope of AS bias across gene deciles was similarly calculated across Alu and L1 subfamilies.

%AS bias (distribution near 5'-UTR)
\section{Gene-specific variables associated with RT distribution}
Different genes have different transcriptional requirements. Moreover different portions of a gene have different transcriptional and regulational requirements. These will be explored here [NEED TO WRITE MORE THIS IS SO UGLY]


%Correlation of Linear Decay with 5'-UTR
\subsection{Alu and L1 are Decreased Near 5\rq-UTR}
Although, previous studies using raw distances showed that RTs were increased near TSSs, here it was noted that AS were increased over S at a ratio less than expected based on the linear trend from the internal deciles. Therefore, although there was an increase near the TSS, this increase was modified by another factor, likely the exon density. As mentioned earlier, the first decile was defined by the TSS and was therefore enriched for the presence of  5\rq-UTR exons (figure \ref{fig:utr_nosecond}), however the presence of a coding exon (CDS) was not obligatory by the normalization procedure (figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). This suggested the possibility that normalizing by the TSS exaggerated an effect of the UTR on RT density. It was therefore important to first study if AS RT density near the TSS was correlated with the presence of the 5\rq-UTR or was due to another variable (e.g: CDS). To accomplish this, the effect of the 5\rq-UTR had to be seperated from any latent effects correlated with the first decile. To seperate out these effects, genes were identified that contained a second 5\rq-UTR within deciles other than the first decile. These 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs were commonly due to either alternative start positions of transcription, or transcription of a seperate gene that began within the boundaries of another gene. Examples of genes that contained 2$^\circ$  5\rq-UTRs are depicted in figure \ref{fig:25utr}.

Once genes with 2$^\circ$  5\rq-UTRs were identified, they were further grouped into subsets based on the decile location of the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs. For example, Group I genes contained all 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs in the first decile. Group II contained genes where the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs were in the second decile, and so on for all ten deciles (figure \ref{fig:5utr_diag}). The distribution of  5\rq -UTRs within these genes are presented in figure \ref{fig:utr_second}. As expected, the number of 5\rq -UTRs increased in the decile containing the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR (normalized decile 0). The frequencies of all AS and S L1 and Alu were calculated within these gene groups and compared to expectation based on genes lacking any 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs.

\subsubsection{\textit{Alu}}
AS Alu in genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs were similar in density to the AS Alu in genes lacking 2$^\circ$ UTRs (figure \ref{fig:2utr_ASalu}). The normalized, 0, decile containing the 2$^\circ$ UTR (mean: 0.049) was significantly reduced compared to the same decile in genes without 2$^\circ$ UTRs (mean: 0.058) (Student's t-test p < 0.039). S Alu showed a slight trend towards an increase over expectation upstream of the 0 decile (figure \ref{fig:2utr_Salu}). The 0 decile, however, was significantly decreased beyond expectation (mean second UTR: 0.41 ; mean no second UTR: 0.46 ; Student's t-test p < 5.2e-04) similar to the AS Alu.

\subsubsection{\textit{L1}}
The distribution of AS L1 within genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR was somewhat similar to that observed with AS Alu (figure \ref{fig:2utr_ASl1}). Interestingly, there was a slight decrease in L1 density upstream of the 0 decile for AS L1 in genes containing a 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR, followed by an increase, though this decrease was not signficant. The 0 decile was significantly reduced over expectation (mean second UTR: 0.057 ; mean no second UTR: 0.071 ; Student's t-test p < 0.007), although the S L1 were not significantly reduced (p = 0.47) (figure \ref{fig:2utr_Sl1}). These results showed that there was a decrease of L1 and Alu in the presence of a 5\rq-UTR.

%Correlation of Linear Decay with CDS Exon Density
\subsection{Linear decay of AS bias is associated with coding sequence density}
Although 5\rq -UTRs were associated with RT density, CDS exons must still be examined as to their contribution to the effect of reduced RTs near the TSS. Since previous studies have shown that AS RT density was reduced within close proximity to exons, the density of CDS within each decile was calculated. Indeed, CDS density increased at a linear rate across gene deciles (figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). The first decile of genes contained more CDS than the second decile.  AS Alu were inversely correlated with this distribution of CDS (R$^{2}$ = -0.94; one-tailed p <  2.64e-05). S Alu, however, were not correlated with CDS (R$^{2}$ = -0.30; one-tailed p = 0.200)

%Alternative Splicing
%\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{3.2.3 } Coding Potential of the Gene Effects AS bias\\}
%Alu and L1 have often been cited as having the potential to contribute to alternative isoforms of a gene. Both Alu and L1 contain splice donor and acceptor sites and therefore can alter splice signals. Moreover, L1, and in some cases Alu, can cause premature adenylation through the polyadenylation signals located within the sequence. For these reasons, it was important to examine the linear decay of Alu and L1 in genes that are alternatively spliced.

%AS bias and tissue-specificity
\subsection{Tissue-Specificity of the Gene Effects AS bias}
Depending on the functional groups of a gene, it has a different chance of containing large amounts of RTs. For example, housekeeping genes have a predictably higher level of Alu frequency than other gene categories. We therefore tested whether AS bias remained linear when subdivided by gene category. The effect of tissue-specificity was tested by both analyzing the slope of the density of AS as well as correlating the distribution of Alu with the distribution of CDS within tissue-specific gene sets. The linear AS slope remained present in housekeeping genes, but it was not maintained in tissue-specific gene sets. Furthermore, the correlation between ASO-RT frequency and CDS distribution was reduced within tissue-specific gene sets (table \ref{table:tiscor}). Although the sample size of each gene set trended with the R$^{2}$, sample size was not significantly correlated with R$^{2}$ (p = 0.062).

!!!! NEED TO ADD P-VALUES FOR THAT TABLE !!! To determine if differences in gene expression across tissue types was confounding this result, we tested the correlation between ASO frequency and exon density as a function of relative expression in housekeeping and tissue specific genes. There was no link between expression level and the correlation between ASO and exon density (figure 7). Furthermore, since it has been shown that retrotransposons are restricted near constitutively expressed exons [38], we also wanted to check if the loss of antisense bias was affected by alternative splicing. Using the knownAlt annotation track from Hg19 (UCSC Genome Browser), we separated genes into those with known alternative splicing events, and those that are constitutively expressed. We found no significant differences between the distribution of ASO and SO between the two groups (chi-square p > 0.25, p > 0.23 respectively). We further calculated the correlation of ASO Alu density and CDS density within alternatively spliced genes. The negative correlation that is seen across all genes was replicated when examining only genes that are alternatively spliced (Pearson’s correlation coefficient: -0.78, p < 0.008). 


%Internal Binding Motifs
\section{Retrotransposon-specific variables are associated with RT distribution}
\label{sec:motifs}
Although the consensus sequences for Alu and L1 contain many functional DNA binding motifs, each individual RT in the genome is variable as to whether or not it contains these motifs. The loss or gain of a motif may occur by mutation at the nucleotide level (figure \ref{fig:motif}), through retrotransposition of a parent element that has already lost or gained the motif sequence, or through truncation of the element during integration. Protein binding motifs can impact both RT expression as well as gene expression. For example, the 5’ portion of the polymerase III promoter (Pol-III) contains the A-box motif which is necessary for transcription factor binding and expression of Alu retrotransposons [39]. The YY-1 binding motif contained within L1 is both a component of the core promoter necessary for  L1 transcription [40] as well as a general transcriptional repressor [41]. CpGs which are common in Alu and L1 can potentially effect levels of gene transcription [42] when methylated. Additionally due to the process of deamination, 5-methylcytosines are more likely to be mutated to thymines than non-methylated cytosines [43], and are commonly mutated in Alu [44]. The SRY motif is a binding domain for the testis-determining factor gene SRY which increases L1 transcription in 293 cells [45], and RUNX3 binding can act as both an activator and repressor of transcription and whose repression is linked with tumour progression [46].

The consensus sequences for these two elements are presented respectively. As expected, both consensus sequences contain the RNA Polymerase III A-box that is required for Alu expression, and therefore Alu retrotransposition. One further protein binding region is highlighted in each sequence, though these binding regions are exclusive to the subfamily of origin. AluJo contains a polyadenylation sequence within the central A-rich region. This polyadenylation signal has been lost in the AluSc consensus sequence (AAATAAA | AAATA\textbf{G}A). Similarly AluSc contains a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 binding site that is not present in AluJo (GAGGTCAAGAGATCG | GAG\textbf{C}C\textbf{C}A\textbf{G}GAG\textbf{T}TCG).}}

         %Truncated L1
\subsection{Truncated L1 Escape Depletion Near the 5\rq-UTR}
The human L1 consensus sequence is approximately 6kb, although it varies by subfamily. During retrotransposition L1 are often truncated, resulting in an average size of 900bp [1]. Reverse transcription of the RNA template initiates near the 3\rq end of RNA and often the L1 retrotransposase is unable to complete retrotransposition of the entire element into the insertion site, resulting in truncation of the 5\rq end [47,48]. In the human genome L1 are variable in size, a majority of which are less than 1 kb (table 6). The 5\rq region of L1, which is often lost during truncation, contains the Polymerase II promoter which can effect expression of neighbouring genes [19,20]. To identify whether L1 (<1kb) lack the promoter region, we determined the start position of each L1 (<1kb) within the respective consensus using local RepeatMasker (figure 9a).  The results indicate that a majority of these small L1 begin after the canonical promoter sequence. 
To test whether the linear decay of antisense oriented L1 was related to the size of the element, we calculated the proportions of L1 <1kb, 1-2kb, 3-4kb, and 5kb+ versus expectation based on all L1. Fischer\rq s exact test p-values were calculated between the count of observed size-specific L1 and the expectation within bins 1 and 2 since these bins had the largest effects of antisense bias. We found that full-length L1 (5kb+) were greatly reduced in frequency near the 5\rq region of the gene compared to expectation (figure 9). This was true of L1 in both orientations. Conversely small L1, < 1kb, were increased near the 5\rq -UTR. The small sample size for the full length L1 in the second decile may be playing a role in their failure to pass significance after Bonferroni correction.

\subsection{Binding motifs in Alu}

Binding motifs were counted in a subset of Alu consensus sequences (table \ref{table:consensusAlu}). As noted above, most motifs were only present in a subset of the consensus sequences, and some motifs were not present in any of the sequences in the table. Other than the Pol-III (Pol3) promoter sequence, OTX2, PITX2, and LYF1 were present in all of the consensus sequences in the table.

These motifs were counted in intergenic Alu and normalized by the total number of intergenic Alu (figure \ref{fig:aluintmotif}). These values were calculated to act as a reference point for examining the changes in motif distribution based on placement of the element. As expected, based on the load of CpGs within the Alu consensus sequence, CpGs were the most prevalent motif in intergenic Alu. The next most prevalent motifs were PITX2, LYF1, and OTX2. This was also expected based on the presence of these elements with in every consensus sequence tested. 
         
    %Figure Alu motifs intergenic

    \end{figure}

The proportions of intergenic Alu motifs were then used to normalize the proportions of binding motifs identified in Alu that resided within genes (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs}). As with intergenic Alu, the count of motifs were first normalized by the number of elements within each region analyzed. Interestingly, even after this normalization procedure, the proportion of any given motif seemed to be effected more by the placement within a gene, than the sequence of the motif. For example, all of the motifs located within AS Alu had values above 1.2, independent of the type of motif. Similarly, all of the motifs within S Alu had values below 0.8.


    %Linear Regression Equation 1 : Alu motif
    \begin{equation}
    \label{Alu1}

ANOVA was performed to determine if the effect of placement was significantly more than the effect of motif (equations \ref{Alu1} and \ref{Alu2}). Placement did indeed have a more significant effect on the proportion of motif than the sequence of motif (p$_{placement}$ < 2.2e-16; p$_{sequence}$ = 0.99) . Interestingly, despite the Alu Pol-III promoter being present in all Alu consensus sequences, it was reduced in all placements compared to intergenic Alu.

\subsection{Binding motifs in L1}
The motifs present within intergenic L1 are plotted in figure \ref{fig:l1intmotif}. Again, CpGs were the most prevalent motif in intergenic L1 followed by the polyadenylation sequence. The proportions of motifs in intergenic L1 were compared to the proportions within genes. As before, the values were normalized by the total number of elements in the respective region prior to comparison versus intergenic L1. Contrary to the pattern seen with Alu, L1 showed no trend of enrichment based on the placement within the gene. Instead the sequence of the motif had a larger effect on the proportion of motifs (p$_{placement}$ = 0.78; p$_{sequence}$ < 3.56e-13). Furthermore, unlike Alu, all motifs within L1 were reduced in genes compared to intergenically, with the largest depletion present within the SRY motif.

        \label{fig:l1motifs}
    \end{figure}

These results indicate that the sequence of both Alu and L1 are differentially maintained in genes vesrus intergenically. It must be noted, however, that since RTs within genes are more likely to be younger than RTs outside of genes, that there may be an inherent bias to detecting the difference in motifs. However, since age was calculated as the number of mismatches from consensus, it would be more likely that there would be an increase in the proportion of motifs since there would be less deviations from consensus. Therefore, although there is a possibility that these results are skewed due to differences in subfamily proportions between intergenic and within genes, the results are skewed in the opposite direction than would be expected.

Since the previous analysis may have bias due to altered subfamily distributions, further analysis using conservation values was performed. Conservation values used in this analysis were from the phyloP basewise conservation scores, where positive values indicated evidence of positive selection, and negative values indicated evidence of purifying selection. Importantly, conservation was only calculated within regions that matched the binding motif within the human reference sequence. Therefore, as opposed to the previous analysis which modelled the loss of binding motifs in the human reference, this calculation analyzed motifs that were present in humans but potentially lost in non-human primates.

Since the polyadenylation sequence was present within both Alu and L1 consensus sequences, this was the first motif analyzed. Basewise conservation scores were averaged for each base within the polyadenylation sequence of either L1 (figure \ref{fig:l1polyA}) or Alu (figure \ref{fig:alupolyA}). L1 and Alu elements were first separated into AS and S elements before calculating the conservation scores. Interestingly, both Alu and L1 show a decrease in conservation at the central T base. Moreover, polyadenylation signals of L1 in the sense orientation have a lower conservation score on average than those of AS oriented L1.

        \label{fig:alupol3}
    \end{figure}
   
Conservation of the Alu-specific Pol-III A-box (figure \ref{fig: alupol3}) was also examined in both the AS and S orientations. The Pol-III A-box is required for transcription and retrotransposition of Alu. Moreover, it may effect transcription of Pol-II genes by maintaining the gene in an open chromatin state, therefore allowing for increased recruitment of Pol-II transcription factors [REF]. When normalized versus intergenic values, there was no major difference between AS and S conservation signals.

There are four CpGs within the Pol-III A-box consensus sequence. The cytosine within a CpG context is more likely to undergo mutation than other nucleotides due to the common deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Suprisingly, only one of the four CpGs present within the queried sequence (position 20) was less conserved than the same position integenically. Two bp in the Pol-III sequence were more highly conserved within genes than intergenically. These were the cytosine at position 3 and guanine at position 15.

These results indicated that each position within a RT-contained binding motif had a different expectation of conservation. Interestingly, the polyadenylation sequence, had a similar dynamic of conservation  independent of the element within which it resided. Moreover, the S L1 had a complete reduction of the polyadenylation signal, whereas the AS L1, S Alu, and AS Alu all had reductions only in the central thymine. This indicates that S polyadenylation signals may be strongly purified from within genes. Evidence in the literature that S L1 contribute to pre-mature polyadenylation substatiates this hypothesis. 

\section{Interaction between Gene-specific and RT-specific variables}
    %Functional Binding Motifs Effect Maintenance, Tissue Specific
\subsection{Functional Binding Motifs Effect Maintenance, Tissue Specific}
Next it was determined how the RT-specific variable of binding motifs is effected by the gene-specific variable of tissue-specific gene expression. To reduce the number of statistical tests, analysis was restricted to the deciles that contained the extremes of Alu and L1 frequency. These were deciles 2 and 9, otherwise defined as the first and last bins within the linear range of Alu/L1 frequency (section \ref{sec:as_dec}). To correct for differences in overall abundance of RTs depending on placement, motif frequencies were normalized by the count of AS or S elements within the respective bin. This was repeated separately for tissue-specific (TS) genes and house-keeping (HK) genes.

Since there was no normalization against intergenic in this analysis, the changes in proportion due to each motif was observable for this analysis (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs_tshk}). The proportion of motifs in each placement within TS genes were compared to the counterpart in HK genes. In general proportions of motifs in TS genes were larger than HK genes (87 of 140). 29 of the 140 comparisons were significant after Bonferonni correction ($\alpha$ = 3.6e-04) (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs_tshk}). Many of these comparisons were from polyadenylation sequences (N = 5 of 7 possible), and LUN1 (N = 4 of 7 possible). The majority of the significant comparisons were derived from whole gene comparisons (10 of 29 tests).
