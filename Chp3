\chapter{\\VARIABLES INFLUENCING RETROTRANSPOSON DISTRIBUTION IN GENES}

Retrotransposons (RTs) comprise approximately half of the human genome and contribute to chromatin structure, regulatory motifs, and protein-coding sequences. Upon insertion, RTs can disrupt functional genetic elements as well as introduce new sequence motifs to a region. They therefore have the potential to effect the function of genes in which they insert. It is hypothesized that the phenotypic impact of RTs on genes is a contributing factor to the non-random distribution of RTs across the genome. An example of this non-random distribution is antisense bias (AS bias) of elements within genes (chapter 2).  Although some of the variables associated with non-random distributions of RTs are understood, many variables remain unstudied. Specifically, there are many variables that have the potential to impact gene expression that have not been analyzed in association with RT distribution.

The detailed characterization of these associations is important to understand the impact of RTs within differing genomic locations. Determining which variables are most associated with decreases in RT distribution could help inform predictions of the severity of phenotypic consequence of \textit{de novo} as well as polymorphic RT insertions. The thousands of RT polymorphisms that are present between any two individuals \cite{Stewart2011} could then be filtered in a manner akin to the filtering of current SNP studies. RT distribution analyses would therefore, inform future disease studies attempting to associate genetic variability with disease phenotypes. Variables that are associated with the RT (e.g. length of element, orientation, sequence) as well as variables that are associated with the gene (e.g. tissue expression, density of coding sequence) will be examined in this section.  


%ASbias (Linear Decay)
\section{The Current Distribution of Alu and L1 within Genes}
%Linear Decay
The dependency of AS bias on position within a gene was calculated for both Alu and L1, where position was defined as one of ten deciles of a gene. RefSeq genes were divided into these deciles using the boundaries of transcription start site (TSS) and transcription stop site, including introns (figure \ref{fig:decile}). Previous research had used distance from the TSS to examine RT density, this alternative approach of normalizating genes by length expanded the scope of the analysis to examine the effect of relative position on RT density, and therefore the ability to detect any regions of the gene that were more sensitive to RT insertions. A side-effect of normalizing by the TSS and transcription stop positions was that every decile 1 (first decile) and decile 10 (last decile) necessarily contained an exon. Since deciles 2 - 9 (internal deciles) were not defined by any discrete exon boundary, they were variable with respect to the presence of an exon. For this reason many analyses were restricted to the internal deciles. It must be noted that although the first and last deciles inevitably contained an exon, it was not necessarily a coding exon (i.e.: 5\rq-UTR or 3\rq-UTR only).

\subsection{L1 and Alu Antisense Bias Exhibits a Linear Decay Across Gene Deciles}
\label{sec:as_dec}
RTs are increased in number near TSSs compared to transcription stop sites. It was first important to determine if examining RT distribution, while normalizing genes by length, replicated these findings. AS and S RTs were counted within each decile across all RefSeq genes and normalized by the total number of  RTs in all deciles (AS + S) for both Alu and L1.

\subsubsection{\textit{Alu}}
AS and S Alu were counted in each decile and normalized by the total number of Alu within all deciles (figure \ref{fig:lineardecay_alu}). Replicating previous findings, there was an increase in elements near the TSS (decile 1) compared to the end of the gene. Also as expected due to the known AS-bias, there were more AS Alu than S Alu overall. Alu in the S orientation were distributed relatively equally across the internal deciles with drops in density in deciles 1 and 10. Conversely, AS Alu exhibited a linear decay in distribution from decile 2 to decile 9. Similarly to Alu on the S strand, AS Alu also showed decreased in density, outside of the linear decrease, in deciles 1 and 10.

    \label{fig:lineardecay_alu}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsubsection{\textit{L1}}
L1 had a similar distribution to Alu when within genes. Again, as expected due to the overall AS bias, there was an increase in AS L1 compared to S L1. Throughout the internal deciles (2 - 9), S L1 remained at a relatively constant distribution, though it must be noted that there was more variability between these deciles, than observed with Alu. AS L1 exhibited a linear decile across the internal deciles (figure \ref{fig:lineardecay_l1}). The overall difference between AS L1 and S L1 within each decile, was larger than what was observed in Alu. This was emphasized by AS and S elements having reached a point of equal density in the last inner decile for Alu, while AS L1 remain more prevalent than S in every decile. \\

    \label{fig:lineardecay_l1}
    \end{figure}
   
\subsubsection{\textit{Linear Decay of Alu and L1}}
Both AS L1 and Alu began at a relatively high frequency in decile 2 and declined linearly until decile 9. The rate of AS decay across gene deciles was determined by analyzing these internal deciles only. This avoided the confounding effects from the process of normalization. Slopes were calculated with the counts of raw elements as opposed to the proportions to facilitate interpretation (table \ref{table:lindecay}). As expected, the decile number had a significant impact on AS density in both Alu and L1, with Alu reduced by -994 elements per decile and L1 by -1410 elements per decile. S elements were not significantly effected by the decile within which they resided.

        \label{table:lindecay}
    \end{table}

Previous research suggested that RTs increased in a peak around the TSS. The results presented here using normalized gene lengths revealed that RTs are not only increased in density near the TSS, but are increased as a function of the normalized distance from the TSS. Moreover, the enrichment of elements is restricted to AS elements. If the increase near the TSS was purely due to a structural change in accessibility, it would be expected that both AS and S elements would be increased near the TSS. Therefore, these results indicated that there may be a functional link between the orientation of elements and the propensity to which they are maintained within genes. Furthermore, there is a difference in this propensity near the TSS as opposed to near the 3\rq -end of a gene.

%AS bias (distribution near 5'-UTR)
\section{Gene-specific Variables Associated with Retrotransposon Distribution}
%Correlation of Linear Decay with CDS Exon Density
\subsection{Linear Decay of AS Bias is Associated with Coding Sequence Density}
\label{sec:cds}
The linear decay of RTs across gene deciles may be contributed to by a number of factors. The most likely of these is the presence of coding sequence exons (CDS), since these are the most conserved units of a gene. Furthermore, Zhang et. al. showed that RTs were less often located in close proximity to an exon. Therefore the density of CDS within each decile was calculated. Indeed, CDS density increased at a linear rate across gene deciles (figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). The first decile of genes contained more CDS than the second decile.  AS Alu were inversely correlated with this distribution of CDS (R$^{2}$ = -0.94; one-tailed p <  2.64e-05). S Alu, however, were not correlated with CDS (R$^{2}$ = -0.30; one-tailed p = 0.200). These results suggest that AS RTs are highly inversely correlated with CDS exon density.

        \label{fig:cds_noUTR}
    \end{figure}

%Alternative Splicing
\subsection{Alternative Splicing}
Alu and L1 both contain cryptic splice sequences that are often used for alternative splicing. It was therefore investigated whether genes with alternative isoforms have a different AS bias than constitutively expressed genes. Using the knownAlt annotation track from Hg19 (UCSC Genome Browser), we separated genes into those with known alternative splicing events, and those that were constitutively expressed. We found no significant differences between the distribution of AS and S between the two groups (chi-square p > 0.25, p > 0.23 respectively). We further calculated the correlation of AS Alu density and CDS density within alternatively spliced genes. The negative correlation that is seen across all genes was replicated when examining only genes that are alternatively spliced (Pearson’s correlation coefficient: -0.78, p < 0.008). Therefore, there was no observable difference between alternatively spliced and constitutively spliced genes.

%Correlation of Linear Decay with 5'-UTR
\subsection{Alu and L1 are Decreased Near 5\rq-UTR}
Although, previous studies using raw distances showed that RTs were increased near TSSs, here it was noted that AS were increased over S at a ratio less than expected based on the linear trend from the internal deciles. Therefore, although there was an increase near the TSS, this increase was modified by another factor, likely the exon density. As mentioned earlier, the first decile was defined by the TSS and was therefore enriched for the presence of  5\rq-UTR exons (figure \ref{fig:utr_nosecond}), however the presence of a coding exon (CDS) was not obligatory by the normalization procedure (figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). This suggested the possibility that normalizing by the TSS exaggerated an effect of the UTR on RT density. It was therefore important to first study if AS RT density near the TSS was correlated with the presence of the 5\rq-UTR or was due to another variable (e.g: CDS). To accomplish this, the effect of the 5\rq-UTR had to be separated from any latent effects correlated with the first decile. To separate out these effects, genes were identified that contained a second 5\rq-UTR within deciles other than the first decile. These 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs were commonly due to either alternative start positions of transcription, or transcription of a separate gene that began within the boundaries of another gene. Examples of genes that contained 2$^\circ$  5\rq-UTRs are depicted in figure \ref{fig:25utr}.

Once genes with 2$^\circ$  5\rq-UTRs were identified, they were further grouped into subsets based on the decile location of the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs. For example, Group I genes contained all 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs in the first decile. Group II contained genes where the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs were in the second decile, and so on for all ten deciles (figure \ref{fig:5utr_diag}). The distribution of  5\rq -UTRs within these genes are presented in figure \ref{fig:utr_second}. As expected, the number of 5\rq -UTRs increased in the decile containing the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR (normalized decile 0). The frequencies of all AS and S L1 and Alu were calculated within these gene groups and compared to expectation based on genes lacking any 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs.

\subsubsection{\textit{Alu}}
AS Alu in genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs were similar in density to the AS Alu in genes lacking 2$^\circ$ UTRs (figure \ref{fig:2utr_ASalu}). The normalized, 0, decile containing the 2$^\circ$ UTR (mean: 0.049) was significantly reduced compared to the same decile in genes without 2$^\circ$ UTRs (mean: 0.058) (Student's t-test p < 0.039). S Alu showed a slight trend towards an increase over expectation upstream of the 0 decile (figure \ref{fig:2utr_Salu}). The 0 decile, however, was significantly decreased beyond expectation (mean second UTR: 0.41 ; mean no second UTR: 0.46 ; Student's t-test p < 5.2e-04) similar to the AS Alu.

\subsubsection{\textit{L1}}
The distribution of AS L1 within genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR was somewhat similar to that observed with AS Alu (figure \ref{fig:2utr_ASl1}). Interestingly, there was a slight decrease in L1 density upstream of the 0 decile for AS L1 in genes containing a 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR, followed by an increase, though this decrease was not significant. The 0 decile was significantly reduced over expectation (mean second UTR: 0.057 ; mean no second UTR: 0.071 ; Student's t-test p < 0.007), although the S L1 were not significantly reduced (p = 0.47) (figure \ref{fig:2utr_Sl1}). These results showed that there was a decrease of L1 and Alu in the presence of a 5\rq-UTR.

\subsubsection{Coding Sequence Accounts for the Variablility Identified in the Antisense Orientation}

The results so far suggested that there was a decrease of RTs near the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR when the position within the gene was normalized. This was important to note since it had previously been shown that RTs were increased near the 5\rq -UTRs in multiple species \cite(VanDeLagemaat2003).  In section \ref{sec:cds} it was shown that RTs were strongly inversely correlated with CDS density. Since the first CDS exon of a gene is often, but not always, connected to the 5\rq -UTR, it was important to determine if the CDS density in 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR genes had an effect on RT density.

The CDS density and Alu density within non- 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR containing genes was used to predict the expected Alu density in 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR containing genes. To accomplish this, Alu density was regressed on CDS density. The CDS density of each 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR gene group was then calculated and used as new data to predict the expected 5\rq-UTR density. The actual values are plotted next to the predicted values in figure \ref{fig:25_cdspred}. In the AS orientation, there was no difference in Alu density from what was expected based on CDS density. Conversely, in the S orientation, there were less Alu in regions containing a 5\rq-UTR than expected based on CDS density alone. 

Overall these results are important to the field of RT research. They support a shift in the common thinking of RT accumulation within genes. Previous speculations were that RTs are increased near 5\rq -UTRs due to advantageous effects of the RT (e.g.: CpGs, enhancers) \cite(VanDeLagemaat2003). Conversely, this current research suggests that the increase of RTs near the 5\rq - UTR is not an effect of the UTR, but an effect of the lack of CDS sequences. Moreover, there was no evidence of an increase near the 5\rq -UTR when position within the gene was normalized. Instead, there was significant decrease in Alu density in the S orientation.

%AS bias and tissue-specificity
\subsection{Tissue-Specificity of the Gene Effects Antisense Bias}
Housekeeping genes have a predictably higher level of Alu frequency than other gene categories \cite{Eller2007}. It was therefore tested whether AS bias remained linear when subdivided by tissue-expression category. The effect of tissue-specificity was tested by both analyzing the slope of the density of AS as well as correlating the distribution of Alu with the distribution of CDS within tissue-specific gene sets. The linear AS slope remained present in housekeeping genes, but it was not maintained in tissue-specific gene sets. Furthermore, the correlation between AS frequency and CDS distribution was reduced within tissue-specific gene sets (table \ref{table:tiscor}). Although the sample size of each gene set trended with the R$^{2}$, sample size was not significantly correlated with R$^{2}$ (R${^2}$ = -0.68; p = 0.062).

To determine if differences in the levels of gene expression across tissue types was confounding this result, we tested the correlation between AS frequency and exon density as a function of relative expression in housekeeping and tissue specific genes. There was no association between expression level in the respective tissue and the correlation between AS and exon density (R$^{2}$ = 0.60 ; p = 0.15).

Overall these results indicated that the tissue-specificity of the gene in which a RT is located was associated with the AS bias. AS bias was more prevalent in housekeeping genes, which also have higher numbers of RTs, and less prevalent in genes that expressed specifically in the pancreas, colon, and liver.  

%Internal Binding Motifs
\section{Retrotransposon-specific Variables are Associated with Retrotransposon Distribution}
\label{sec:motifs}
The consensus sequences for Alu and L1 contain many functional DNA binding motifs. Some of these binding motifs act as enhancers, or repressors of gene expression. Although the consensus sequence of RTs contain many binding motifs, each individual RT in the genome is variable as to whether or not it contains these motifs. The loss or gain of a motif may occur by mutation at the nucleotide level (figure \ref{fig:motif}), through retrotransposition of a parent element that has already lost or gained the motif sequence, or through truncation of the element during integration.

Protein binding motifs can impact both RT expression as well as gene expression. For example, the 5\rq portion of the polymerase III promoter (Pol-III) contains the A-box motif which is necessary for transcription factor binding and expression of Alu retrotransposons. The YY-1 binding motif contained within L1 is both a component of the core promoter necessary for  L1 transcription as well as a general transcriptional repressor. CpGs which are common in Alu and L1 can potentially effect levels of gene transcription when methylated. Additionally due to the process of deamination, 5-methylcytosines are more likely to be mutated to thymines than non-methylated cytosines, and are commonly mutated in Alu. The SRY motif is a binding domain for the testis-determining factor gene SRY which increases L1 transcription in 293 cells, and RUNX3 binding can act as both an activator and repressor of transcription and whose repression is linked with tumor progression.

These binding motifs can have an effect on gene expression, and some of these motifs are orientation specific (e.g.: polyadenylation sequences). The relative presence of these motifs within genes was compared to intergenic motifs to determine whether some motifs were excluded from genes, thereby indicating a functional impact on the organism.

One further protein binding region is highlighted in each sequence, though these binding regions are exclusive to the subfamily of origin. AluJo contains a polyadenylation sequence within the central A-rich region. This polyadenylation signal has been lost in the AluSc consensus sequence (AAATAAA | AAATA\textbf{G}A). Similarly AluSc contains a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 binding site that is not present in AluJo (GAGGTCAAGAGATCG | GAG\textbf{C}C\textbf{C}A\textbf{G}GAG\textbf{T}TCG).}}

         %Truncated L1
\subsection{Truncated L1 Escape Depletion Near the 5\rq-UTR}
The full-length human L1 consensus sequence is approximately 6kb, but varies by subfamily. Commonly, however, L1 are approximately 900 bp on average. The shorter average sequence is due to malfunctions during retrotransposition where L1 are often truncated. Reverse transcription of the RNA template initiates near the 3\rq end of RNA and often the L1 retrotransposase is unable to complete retrotransposition of the entire element into the insertion site, resulting in truncation of the 5\rq end.

This 5\rq -truncation of L1 results in variable sizes of L1 in the human genome, with a majority being less than 1 kb (table \ref{table:l1size}). The 5\rq region of L1, that is often lost during truncation, contains the Polymerase II promoter which can effect expression of neighboring genes. It is likely that this promoter region of L1 effects gene expression. To determine if L1 with promoters have a different distribution within genes than L1 without promoters, the distributions of L1 of varying sizes were calculated.

Since size was used as a proxy for the presence of the L1 promoter, it was important to determine the presence of the L1 promoter within short L1 (< 1kb). The L1 promoter region is within the first 2kb of the L1 consensus sequence. To identify whether L1 (<1kb) lack the promoter region, the start position of each short L1 (<1kb) within the respective consensus. A histogram of the start positions within the consensus sequence are presented in figure \ref{fig:l1start}).  The enrichment near 6kb indicated that the 5\rq -most portion of short L1 was located many kb downstream of the L1 promoter sequence. Therefore, a majority of these small L1 did not contain the canonical promoter sequence. It was therefore hypothesized that short L1 would not be under the same purifying selection as full-length L1, and would be present at higher levels than full-length L1.

To test whether the linear decay of antisense oriented L1 was related to the size of the element, the proportions of L1 <1kb, 1-2kb, 3-4kb, 4-5kb, and 5kb+ were calculated within all genes. All groups of AS L1 had a similar distribution to all AS L1 (figure \ref{fig:l1size_as}). When all size ranges were compared within the first decile it was noted that the proportion of AS L1 was higher with decreased length of the element (figure \ref{fig:l1size_as_one}) .

\subsection{Protein Binding Motifs in Alu}

Protein binding motifs other than the Pol-II promoter are highly concentrated in both Alu and L1 consensus sequences. Since L1 containing a Pol-II promoter region were decreased near the 5\rq -region of genes, it was further hypothesized that other protein binding motifs modify the distribution of RTs within genes. Binding motifs within the Alu consensus sequence were analyzed for changes versus expectation. As noted previously, most motifs were only present in a subset of the consensus sequences. Therefore, binding motifs were first counted in a subset of Alu consensus sequences to determine the relative expectation of identifying each motifs (table \ref{table:consensusAlu}). Some motifs were present multiple times within an individual consensus sequence (e.g.: CpG, OTX2), while some motifs were not present in any of the consensus sequences analyzed (e.g: BRN2, DR2). Other than the Pol-III (Pol3) promoter sequence, OTX2, PITX2, and LYF1 were present in all of the consensus sequences in the table.

This was also expected based on the presence of these elements with in every consensus sequence tested.

The proportions of motifs within intergenic Alu were used to normalize the proportions of binding motifs identified within genes (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs}). To correct for differences in the total number of Alu within different regions of the genome, the count of motifs were first normalized by the number of elements within each region analyzed. After this normalization procedure, the proportion of any given motif was effected more by the placement within a gene, than the sequence of the motif. For example, all of the motifs located within AS Alu had values above 1.2, independent of the type of motif. Similarly, all of the motifs within S Alu had values below 0.8.

ANOVA was performed to determine if the effect of placement (i.e: sense, antisense, in genes, 5\rq -, 3\rq -) was significantly more than the effect of the sequence of the motif (equations \ref{Alu1} and \ref{Alu2}). Placement did indeed have a more significant effect on the proportion of motif than the sequence of motif (p$_{placement}$ < 2.2e-16; p$_{sequence}$ = 0.99).

\subsection{Protein Binding Motifs in L1}
The proportions of motifs in intergenic L1 were compared to the proportions within genes. As before, the values were normalized by the total number of elements in the respective region prior to comparison versus intergenic L1. Contrary to the pattern seen with Alu, L1 showed no trend of enrichment based on the placement within the gene. Instead the sequence of the motif had a significant effect on the proportion of motifs (p$_{placement}$ = 0.78; p$_{sequence}$ < 3.56e-13). Furthermore, unlike Alu, all motifs within L1 were reduced in genes compared to intergenically. The largest depletion present was of the SRY motif.

These results indicated that the sequence of both Alu and L1 were differentially maintained in genes versus intergenically.

Conversely, binding motifs within L1 were reduced depending on the sequence of the motif.

The previous analysis examined the distribution of binding motifs by calculating the lack of motifs in the reference human genome. It was also important to analyze the distribution of binding motifs through the conservation status, which would examine the motifs that are present in the human genome. Moreover, analyzing the conservation scores would allow a base-by-base analysis of the binding motif. Conservation values used in this analysis were from the phyloP basewise conservation scores, where positive values indicated evidence of positive selection, and negative values indicated evidence of purifying selection. Importantly, conservation was only calculated within regions that matched the binding motif within the human reference sequence. Therefore, as opposed to the previous analysis which modeled the loss of binding motifs in the human reference, this calculation analyzed the individual basepairs within motifs that were present in humans but potentially lost in non-human primates.

Since the polyadenylation sequence was present within both Alu and L1 consensus sequences, this was the first motif analyzed. Basewise conservation scores were averaged for each base within the polyadenylation sequence of either L1 (figure \ref{fig:l1polyA}) or Alu (figure \ref{fig:alupolyA}). L1 and Alu elements were first separated into AS and S elements before the conservation scores were calculated. Interestingly, both Alu and L1 showed a decrease in conservation at the central T base. Moreover, polyadenylation signals of L1 in the sense orientation had a lower conservation score on average than those of AS oriented L1.

Conservation of the Alu-specific Pol-III A-box (figure \ref{fig: alupol3}) was also examined in both the AS and S orientations. The Pol-III A-box is required for transcription and retrotransposition of Alu. When normalized versus intergenic values, there was no major difference between AS and S conservation signals, similar to what was observed for the polyadenylation signal within Alu.

There are four CpGs within the Pol-III A-box consensus sequence. The cytosine within a CpG context is more likely to undergo mutation than other nucleotides due to the common deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Surprisingly, only one of the four CpGs present within the queried sequence (position 20) was less conserved than the same position intergenically. Two bp in the Pol-III sequence were more highly conserved within genes than intergenically. These were the cytosine at position 3 and guanine at position 15.

These results indicated that each position within a RT-contained binding motif had a different expectation of conservation. Interestingly, the polyadenylation sequence, had a similar dynamic of conservation  independent of the element within which it resided. Moreover, the S L1 had a complete reduction of the polyadenylation signal, whereas the AS L1, S Alu, and AS Alu all had reductions only in the central thymine. This indicated that S polyadenylation signals may be strongly purified from within genes. Evidence in the literature that S L1 contribute to pre-mature polyadenylation substantiates this hypothesis \cite{Kaer2011}.

Lastly, it was determined how the RT-specific variable of binding motifs was effected by the gene-specific variable of tissue-specific gene expression. To reduce the number of statistical tests, analysis was restricted to the deciles that contained the extremes of Alu and L1 frequency. These were deciles 2 and 9, otherwise defined as the first and last bins within the linear range of Alu/L1 frequency (section \ref{sec:as_dec}). To correct for differences in overall abundance of RTs depending on placement, motif frequencies were normalized by the count of AS or S elements within the respective bin. This was repeated separately for tissue-specific (TS) genes and house-keeping (HK) genes.

Since there was no normalization against intergenic in this analysis, the changes in proportion due to each motif was observable for this analysis (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs_tshk}). The proportion of motifs in each placement within TS genes were compared to the counterpart in HK genes. In general proportions of motifs in TS genes were larger than HK genes (87 of 140). 29 of the 140 comparisons were significant after Bonferonni correction ($\alpha$ = 3.6e-04) (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs_tshk}). Many of these comparisons were from polyadenylation sequences (N = 5 of 7 possible), and LUN1 (N = 4 of 7 possible). The majority of the significant comparisons were derived from whole gene comparisons (10 of 29 tests).

For L1-contained motifs, all proportions of motifs were greater in TS genes than the respective placement in HK genes (56 of 56) (figure \ref{fig:l1_tshkmotifs_value}). 35 of the 56 comparisons were significant after Bonferonni correction ($\alpha$ = 8.9e-04) (figure \ref{fig:l1motifs_tshk}). The majority of the significant comparisons were within polyadenylation sequences (N = 7 of 7 possible), and the second variation of RUNX3 (N$_{b}$ = 6 of 7 possible).
