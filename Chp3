\chapter{\\VARIABLES INFLUENCING RETROTRANSPOSON DISTRIBUTION IN GENES}

Retrotransposons (RTs) comprise approximately half of the human genome and contribute to chromatin structure, regulatory motifs, and protein-coding sequences \citep{Lander2001,Krull2005,Englander1995}. Upon insertion, RTs can disrupt functional genetic elements as well as introduce new sequence motifs to a region \citep{Belancio2008a}. They therefore have the potential to effect the function of genes in which they insert.

It is hypothesized that this phenotypic impact of RTs on genes is a contributing factor to the non-random distribution of RTs across the genome. An example of non-random distribution being the propensity for a decrease of RTs in the sense orientation within genes (i.e: antisense bias (AS bias)).  Although some of the variables associated with non-random distributions of RTs are understood (section \ref{sec:dist}), many variables remain unstudied. Specifically, there are many variables that have the potential to impact gene expression that have not been analyzed in association with RT distribution.

In order to understand the impact of RTs within differing genomic locations, it is important to characterize the associations of different variables with RT distribution. Determining which variables are most associated with decreases in RT distribution could help inform predictions of the severity of phenotypic consequence of \textit{de novo} as well as polymorphic RT insertions. RT distribution analyses would therefore, inform future disease studies attempting to associate genetic variability with disease phenotypes.

There are many genomic variables that can be tested for association with changes in RT distribution. Variables that are associated with i.) the RT (e.g. length of element, orientation, sequence) as well as variables that are associated with ii.) the gene (e.g. tissue expression, density of coding sequence) will be examined in this chapter.  


%ASbias (Linear Decay)
\section{The Current Distribution of Alu and L1 within Genes}
%Linear Decay
Since the previous chapter indicated that the ratio of antisense to sense elements (AS bias) was due to a force of selection, the AS bias was used as the initial measure of distribution of RTs in relation to the gene. The dependency of AS bias on position within a gene was calculated for both Alu and L1, where position was defined as one of ten deciles of a gene. RefSeq genes were divided into these deciles using the boundaries of transcription start site (TSS) and transcription stop site, including introns (figure \ref{fig:decile}).

    %Figure Decile Explanation
    \begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption[Normalizing Genes by Length]{\normalsize{\textbf{Normalizing Genes by Length\\} Example of a gene divided into deciles. Deciles are divided by black dashed lines and represented by the orange number above the divisions. Decile 1 contains the first 0-10\% of the gene, and decile 10 contains the last 90-100\% of the gene. Deciles were calculated from transcription start to transcription stop site from the RefSeq annotated genes. The long boxes at the start and stop represent untranslated regions, the smaller internal boxes represent coding exons, and the green line represents the transcribed gene including introns.}}
    \label{fig:decile}
    \end{figure}

Previous research had used distance from the TSS to examine RT density. The alternative approach presented here of normalizating genes by length expanded the scope of the analysis to examine the effect of relative position on RT density. This enables the detection of regions of the gene that were more sensitive to RT insertions independent of length. A side-effect of normalizing by the TSS and transcription stop positions was that every decile 1 (first decile) and decile 10 (last decile) necessarily contained an exon. Since deciles 2 - 9 (internal deciles) were not defined by any discrete exon boundary, they were variable with respect to the presence of an exon. For this reason many analyses were restricted to the internal deciles. It must be noted that although the first and last deciles inevitably contained an exon, it was not necessarily a coding exon (i.e.: 5\rq-UTR or 3\rq-UTR only). 
    
\subsection{L1 and Alu Antisense Bias Exhibits a Linear Decay Across Gene Deciles}
\label{sec:as_dec}
When analyzed by raw distance in bp, RTs are increased in number near TSSs compared to transcription stop sites \citep{Tsirigos2009}. It was first important to determine if examining RT distribution, while normalizing genes by length, replicated these findings. AS and S RTs were counted within each decile across all RefSeq genes and normalized by the total number of  RTs in all deciles (AS + S) for both Alu and L1.

\subsubsection{\textit{Alu}}
AS and S Alu were counted in each decile and normalized by the total number of Alu within all deciles (figure \ref{fig:lineardecay_alu}). Replicating previous findings, there was an increase in elements near the TSS (decile 1, d1) compared to the end of the gene (decile 10, d10). This change was associated with a significant difference in the proportion of AS Alu between deciles 1 and 10 (Test of unequal proportions: prop$_{d1}$ = 0.598 ; prop$_{d10}$ = 0.479; p < 5.67e-262). Also as expected due to the known AS-bias, there were more AS Alu than S Alu overall. Alu in the S orientation were distributed relatively equally across the internal deciles with drops in density in deciles 1 and 10. Conversely, AS Alu exhibited a linear decay in distribution from decile 2 to decile 9. Similarly to Alu on the S strand, AS Alu also showed decreased in density in deciles 1 and 10. This decrease was outside what would be expected based on the linear trend from deciles 2 - 9. Therefore, although they were increased near the TSS more than the transcription stop site, they were decreased compared to decile 2.

    \label{fig:lineardecay_alu}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsubsection{\textit{L1}}
L1 had a similar distribution to Alu when within genes. Again, as expected due to the overall AS bias, there was an increase in AS L1 compared to S L1. Futhermore there was an increase of elements in d1 compared to d10. This increase was associated with a significant change in proportion of AS L1 (Test of unequal proportions: prop$_{d1}$ = 0.709 ; prop$_{d10}$ = 0.588; p < 1.32e-166). Throughout the internal deciles (2 - 9), S L1 remained at a relatively constant distribution, though it must be noted that there was more variability between these deciles, than observed with Alu. AS L1 exhibited a linear decay across the internal deciles (figure \ref{fig:lineardecay_l1}). The overall difference between AS L1 and S L1 within each decile, was larger than what was observed in Alu. This was emphasized by AS and S elements having reached a point of equal density in the last inner decile for Alu, while AS L1 remain more prevalent than S in every decile. \\

    \label{fig:lineardecay_l1}
    \end{figure}
   
\subsubsection{\textit{Linear Decay of Alu and L1}}
Both AS Alu and L1 began at a relatively high frequency in decile 2 and declined linearly until decile 9. The rate of AS decay across gene deciles was determined by analyzing these internal deciles only. This avoided the confounding effects from the process of normalization. Slopes were calculated with the counts of raw elements as opposed to the proportions to facilitate interpretation (table \ref{table:lindecay}). As expected, the decile number had a significant impact on AS density in both Alu and L1, with Alu reduced by 994 elements per decile and L1 by 1410 elements per decile. S elements were not significantly effected by the decile within which they resided (table \ref{table:lindecay}).

Previous research suggested that RTs increased in a peak around the TSS. The results presented here using normalized gene lengths revealed that RTs are not only increased in density near the TSS, but are increased as a function of the normalized distance from the TSS. Moreover, the enrichment of elements is restricted to AS elements. If the increase near the TSS was purely due to a structural change in accessibility, it would be expected that both AS and S elements would be increased near the TSS. Therefore, these results indicated that there may be a functional link between the orientation of elements and the propensity to which they are maintained within genes. Furthermore, there is a difference in this propensity near the TSS as opposed to near the 3\rq -end of a gene. 


%%Change of Linear Decay Over Time
%\subsection{Linear Decay Develops Over Time}
%AS bias in general was shown to increase relatively quickly for Alu, but to change over long periods of evolutionary time in L1. The slope of AS bias across gene deciles was similarly calculated across Alu and L1 subfamilies.

%AS bias (distribution near 5'-UTR)
\section{Gene-specific Variables Associated with Retrotransposon Distribution}
The results so far have indicated that the AS bias of RTs within genes is dependent on the positional context of the element within the gene. Elements that integrate near the 5\rq -end of a gene were distributed differently with respect to orientation than the elements at the 3\ -end of the gene. It is possible that variables associated with the RT as well as variables associated with the gene effect this distribution. First, variables associated with the gene will be explored.

%Correlation of Linear Decay with CDS Exon Density
\subsection{Linear Decay of AS Bias is Associated with Coding Sequence Density}
\label{sec:cds}
The linear decay of RTs across gene deciles may be contributed to by a number of factors. The most likely of these is the presence of coding sequence exons (CDS), since these are the most conserved units of a gene. Furthermore, Zhang et. al. showed that RTs were less often located in close proximity to an exon. Therefore the density of CDS within each decile was calculated. Indeed, CDS density increased at a linear rate across gene deciles (figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). The first decile of genes contained more CDS than the second decile.  AS Alu were inversely correlated with this distribution of CDS (R$^{2}$ = -0.94; one-tailed p <  2.64e-05). S Alu, however, were not correlated with CDS (R$^{2}$ = -0.30; one-tailed p = 0.200). These results suggest that AS RTs are highly inversely correlated with CDS exon density.

    %Figure CDS (no secondary 5'-UTR)

        \label{fig:cds_noUTR}
    \end{figure}

%Alternative Splicing
\subsection{Alternative Splicing}
Alu and L1 both contain cryptic splice sequences that are often used for alternative splicing. It was therefore investigated whether genes with alternative isoforms have a different AS bias than constitutively expressed genes. Using the knownAlt annotation track from Hg19 (UCSC Genome Browser), we separated genes into those with known alternative splicing events, and those that were constitutively expressed. We found no significant differences between the distribution of AS and S between the two groups (chi-square p > 0.25, p > 0.23 respectively). We further calculated the correlation of AS Alu density and CDS density within alternatively spliced genes. The negative correlation that is seen across all genes was replicated when examining only genes that are alternatively spliced (Pearson’s correlation coefficient: -0.78, p < 0.008). Therefore, there was no observable difference between alternatively spliced and constitutively spliced genes.

%Correlation of Linear Decay with 5'-UTR
\subsection{Alu and L1 are Decreased Near 5\rq-UTR}
Although, previous studies using raw distances showed that RTs were increased near TSSs, here it was noted that AS were increased over S at a ratio less than expected based on the linear trend from the internal deciles. Therefore, although there was an increase near the TSS, this increase was modified by another factor such as the exon density. As mentioned earlier, the first decile was defined by the TSS and was therefore enriched for the presence of  5\rq-UTR exons (figure \ref{fig:utr_nosecond}), however the presence of a coding exon (CDS) was not obligatory by the normalization procedure (figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). Although the RT density was highly correlated with CDS density, it was important to study if AS RT density near the TSS was modified by the presence of the 5\rq-UTR. This was especially important because it had been previously claimed that RTs were increased near the TSS due to positive selection \citep{Tsirigos2009}, a hypothesis that would be discounted if instead the increase near the TSS was due only to a reduction in CDS.

        \label{fig:25utr}
    \end{figure}

To determine the effect of the 5\rq -UTR on RT density, the effect of the 5\rq-UTR had to be separated from any latent effects correlated with the first decile. To separate out these effects, genes were identified that contained a second 5\rq-UTR (2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR) within deciles other than the first decile. These 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs were commonly due to either alternative start positions of transcription, or transcription of a separate gene that began within the boundaries of another gene. Examples of genes that contained 2$^\circ$  5\rq-UTRs are depicted in figure \ref{fig:25utr}.

The UTR in the 5\rq-most position was defined as the primary (1$^\circ$) 5\rq-UTR. Dark green genes were grouped by the decile (bin) containing the secondary (2$^\circ$) UTR. All groups were then normalized by the secondary 5\rq-UTR position by defining the bin that contained the 2$^\circ$ UTR as 0. Each bin downstream was defined consecutively as 1, 2, ... 7, and each bin upstream was defined as -1, -2,...-7.}}
        \label{fig:5utr_diag}
    \end{figure}
    
Once genes with 2$^\circ$  5\rq-UTRs were identified, they were further grouped into subsets based on the decile location of the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs. For example, Group I genes contained all 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs in the first decile. Group II contained genes where the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTRs were in the second decile, and so on for all ten deciles (figure \ref{fig:5utr_diag}). The distribution of  5\rq -UTRs within genes with no  2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR is presented in figure \ref{fig:utr_nosecond}, and the distribution within genes these containing a  2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR is presented in figure \ref{fig:utr_second}. As expected, the number of 5\rq -UTRs were generally higher in the decile containing the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR (normalized decile 0). This indicated that the procedure of normalizing by  2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR enriched for 5\rq -UTR sequences in deciles other than the first decile.

In order to interpret the findings properly, it is important to note that each normalized decile did not contain equal numbers of measurements. This is due to the fact that the calculations of upstream and downstream values were contingent on the placement of the 0 decile. Therefore if, before normalization, the zero decile was originally decile 9, there would only be one decile downstream capable of being analyzed and the remaining downstream deciles would not have a value attributed to them. For this reason all deciles are shown in the analyses, however only the 0 decile was used to calculate changes in genes with a 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR versus those that did not have an internal 5\rq-UTR.

S Alu were also similar to expectation except for within the 0 decile (figure \ref{fig:2utr_Salu}). The 0 decile was significantly decreased beyond expectation (mean$_{with\;2^\circ\;5\rq -UTR}$: 0.41 ; mean$_{without \;2^\circ\;5\rq -UTR}$:  0.46 ; Student's t-test p < 5.2e-04) similar to the AS Alu.

\subsubsection{\textit{L1}}
The distribution of AS L1 within genes containing a 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR was somewhat similar to that observed with AS Alu (figure \ref{fig:2utr_ASl1}). The 0 decile of AS L1 was significantly reduced over expectation (mean$_{with\;2^\circ\;5\rq -UTR}$: 0.057 ; mean$_{without\;2^\circ\;5\rq -UTR}$: 0.071 ; Student's t-test p < 0.007), although the S L1 were not significantly reduced (p = 0.47) (figure \ref{fig:2utr_Sl1}).

Togther the decrease of AS Alu and L1 in the decile containing the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq-UTR indicated that there was an effect of the 5\rq -UTR on RT density that was independent of the position within the gene. Interestingly, this finding is contrary to expectation. Since the RT density was increased near the TSS and therefore near the 5\rq -UTR it was hypothesized that there would be an increase of RTs near the 5\rq -UTR.

\subsection{Coding Sequence Accounts for Variability Near 5\rq -UTR}

The results so far suggested that, contrary to expectation, there was a decrease of RTs near the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR when the position within the gene was controlled for. Importantly, in section \ref{sec:cds} it was shown that RTs were inversely correlated with CDS density. Since the first CDS exon of a gene is often, but not always, connected to the 5\rq -UTR, it was important to determine if the CDS density had an effect on the RT distribution observed in genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs.

\subsubsection{CDS Density Differs Near 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR}

First, the CDS density within genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs was identified. Indeed the CDS density within genes that containing a 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs were altered compared to the CDS density in genes with no internal 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs (figure \ref{fig:25_cdsmulti} and figure \ref{fig:cds_noUTR}). The most striking feature was the CDS density in the decile containing the 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR. These genes showed a significant increase in CDS density compared to expectation based on genes lacking internal 5\rq -UTRs (table \ref{table:cdssig}) . This further substantiated studying the effect of CDS density on RT density in genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs.

For genes containing a 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR this was the value in column CDS all deciles$_{2^\circ}$. For genes with no 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR, the total CDS in all deciles was 211134. The proportions were compared between genes with and without 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR in the same deciles using a test of equal proportions.}}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Effect of CDS density on Alu and L1}
The CDS density and Alu density within non-2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR containing genes was used to predict the expected Alu density in 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR containing genes. To accomplish this, Alu density from non-2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTR containing genes was regressed on CDS density from the same genes. The expected RT density was then predicted using the CDS density from genes containing 2$^\circ$ 5\rq -UTRs. For Alu, the actual values were plotted next to the predicted values in figure \ref{fig:25_cdspred}. In the AS orientation, there was no difference in Alu or L1 density from what was expected based on CDS density. Conversely, in the S orientation, there were less Alu and L1 in regions containing a 5\rq-UTR than expected based on CDS density alone (Student's t-test p,$_{Alu}$ < 0.03 ; Student's t-test p,$_{L1}$ < 0.001 ). 

 In summary of the effect of CDS and 5\-rq -UTRs on RT density, there was no evidence of an increase near the 5\rq -UTR when position within the gene was normalized. Instead, there was significant decrease in Alu density in the S orientation. Furthermore, the decrease of AS Alu was largely correlated with an increase in CDS sequence near 5\rq -UTRs. This suggested that the increase of AS RTs near the 5\rq - UTR was not an effect of the UTR, but an effect of the lack of CDS sequences in deciles that were near the 5\rq -end of a gene.

%AS bias and tissue-specificity
\subsection{Tissue-Specificity of the Gene Effects Antisense Bias}
Housekeeping genes have a predictably higher level of Alu frequency than other gene categories \citep{Eller2007}. It was therefore tested whether AS bias remained linear when subdivided by tissue-expression category. The effect of tissue-specificity was tested by both analyzing the slope of the density of AS as well as by correlating the distribution of Alu with the distribution of CDS within tissue-specific gene sets. The linear AS slope remained present in housekeeping genes, but it was not maintained in tissue-specific gene sets. Furthermore, the correlation between AS frequency and CDS distribution was reduced within tissue-specific gene sets (table \ref{table:tiscor}). Although the sample size of each gene set trended with the R$^{2}$, sample size was not significantly correlated with R$^{2}$ (R${^2}$ = -0.68; p = 0.062).

To determine if differences in the levels of gene expression across tissue types was confounding this result, we tested the correlation between AS frequency and exon density as a function of relative expression in housekeeping and tissue specific genes. There was no association between expression level in the respective tissue and the correlation between AS and exon density (R$^{2}$ = 0.60 ; p = 0.15).

Overall these results indicated that the tissue-specificity of the gene in which a RT is located was associated with the AS bias.  AS bias was more prevalent in housekeeping genes, which also have higher numbers of RTs, and less prevalent in genes that were expressed specifically in the pancreas, colon, and liver.  

%Internal Binding Motifs
\section{Retrotransposon-specific Variables are Associated with Retrotransposon Distribution}
\label{sec:motifs}
The consensus sequences for Alu and L1 contain many functional DNA binding motifs. Some of these binding motifs act as enhancers, or repressors of gene expression. Although the consensus sequence of RTs contain many binding motifs, each individual RT in the genome is variable as to whether or not it contains these motifs. The loss or gain of a motif may occur by mutation at the nucleotide level (figure \ref{fig:motif}), through retrotransposition of a parent element that has already lost or gained the motif sequence, or through truncation of the element during integration.

Protein binding motifs can impact both RT expression as well as gene expression. For example, the 5\rq portion of the polymerase III promoter (Pol-III) contains the A-box motif which is necessary for transcription factor binding and expression of Alu retrotransposons. The YY-1 binding motif contained within L1 is both a component of the core promoter necessary for  L1 transcription as well as a general transcriptional repressor. The SRY motif is a binding domain for the testis-determining factor gene SRY which increases L1 transcription in 293 cells, and RUNX3 binding can act as both an activator and repressor of transcription and whose repression is linked with tumor progression.

These binding motifs can have an effect on gene expression, and some of these motifs are orientation specific (e.g.: polyadenylation sequences). The relative presence of these motifs within genes was compared to intergenic motifs to determine whether some motifs were excluded from genes, thereby indicating a functional impact on the organism.

One further protein binding region is highlighted in each sequence, though these binding regions are exclusive to the subfamily of origin. AluJo contains a polyadenylation sequence within the central A-rich region. This polyadenylation signal has been lost in the AluSc consensus sequence (AAATAAA | AAATA\textbf{G}A). Similarly AluSc contains a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 binding site that is not present in AluJo (GAGGTCAAGAGATCG | GAG\textbf{C}C\textbf{C}A\textbf{G}GAG\textbf{T}TCG).}}

         %Truncated L1
\subsection{Truncated L1 Escape Depletion Near the 5\rq-UTR}
The full-length human L1 consensus sequence is approximately 6kb, but varies by subfamily. More commonly, L1 are approximately 900 bp on average. The shorter average sequence compared to full-length is due to malfunctions during retrotransposition where L1 are often truncated. Reverse transcription of the RNA template initiates near the 3\rq end of RNA and often the L1 retrotransposase is unable to complete retrotransposition of the entire element into the insertion site, resulting in truncation of the 5\rq end.

This 5\rq -truncation of L1 results in variable sizes of L1 in the human genome, with a majority being less than 1 kb (table \ref{table:l1size}). The 5\rq -region of L1, that is often lost during truncation, contains the Polymerase II promoter which can effect expression of neighboring genes. It is likely that this promoter region of L1 effects gene expression. To determine if L1 with promoters have a different distribution within genes than L1 without promoters, the distributions of L1 of varying sizes were calculated.

Since size was used as a proxy for the presence of the L1 promoter, it was important to determine the presence of the L1 promoter within short L1 (< 1kb). The L1 promoter region is located within the first 2kb of the L1 consensus sequence. To identify whether L1  that were <1kb lacked the promoter region, the start position of each short L1 (<1kb) within the respective consensus. A histogram of the start positions within the consensus sequence are presented in figure \ref{fig:l1start}).  The enrichment near 6kb indicated that the 5\rq -most portion of short L1 was located many kb downstream of the L1 promoter sequence (N, $_{L1\,>\,2 kb}$ = 654963 ; 87\%). Therefore, the majority of short L1 did not contain the canonical promoter sequence. It was therefore hypothesized that short L1 would not be under the same purifying selection as full-length L1, and would be present at higher levels than full-length L1.

To test whether the linear decay of antisense oriented L1 was related to the size of the element, the proportions of L1 <1kb, 1-2kb, 3-4kb, 4-5kb, and 5kb+ were calculated within all genes. All groups of AS L1 had a similar distribution to all AS L1 (figure \ref{fig:l1size_as}). When all size ranges were compared within the first decile it was noted that the proportion of AS L1 was higher with decreased length of the element (figure \ref{fig:l1size_as_one}) . Importantly, L1 < 1kb in length were present at a significantly higher level than full-length L1 (prop <1kb = 0.0574 ; prop 5+ kb = 0.0437 ; Test for equalities of proportion p < 1.01e-04).

S L1 grouped by length were also similarly distributed to all S, however full-length L1 were significantly reduced in the first decile compared to short L1 (prop <1kb = 0.0237 ; prop 5+ kb = 0.0163 ; Test for equalities of proportion p < 0.0012).

\subsection{Protein Binding Motifs in Alu}

Protein binding motifs other than the Pol-II promoter are highly concentrated in both Alu and L1 consensus sequences. Binding motifs within the Alu consensus sequence were analyzed for changes versus expectation. As noted previously, most motifs were only present in a subset of the consensus sequences. Therefore, binding motifs were first counted in a subset of Alu consensus sequences to determine the relative expectation of identifying each motifs (table \ref{table:consensusAlu}). Some motifs were present multiple times within an individual consensus sequence (e.g.: CpG, OTX2), while some motifs were not present in any of the consensus sequences analyzed (e.g: BRN2, DR2). Other than the Pol-III (Pol3) promoter sequence, OTX2, PITX2, and LYF1 were present in all of the consensus sequences in the table.

%These motifs were counted in intergenic Alu and normalized by the total number of intergenic Alu (figure \ref{fig:aluintmotif}). These values were calculated to act as a reference point for examining the changes in motif distribution based on placement of the element. As expected, based on the load of CpGs within the Alu consensus sequence, CpGs were the most prevalent motif in intergenic Alu. The next most prevalent motifs were PITX2, LYF1, and OTX2. This was also expected based on the presence of these elements with in every consensus sequence tested.

The proportions of motifs within intergenic Alu were used to normalize the proportions of binding motifs identified within genes (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs}). To correct for differences in the total number of Alu within different regions of the genome, the count of motifs were first normalized by the number of elements within each region analyzed. After this normalization procedure, the proportion of any given motif was effected more by the placement within a gene, than the sequence of the motif. For example, all of the motifs located within AS Alu had values above 1.2, independent of the type of motif. Similarly, all of the motifs within S Alu had values below 0.8.

ANOVA was performed to determine if the effect of placement (i.e: sense, antisense, in genes, 5\rq -, 3\rq -) was significantly more than the effect of the sequence of the motif (equations \ref{Alu1} and \ref{Alu2}). Placement did indeed have a more significant effect on the proportion of motif than the sequence of motif (p$_{placement}$ < 2.2e-16; p$_{sequence}$ = 0.99).

The proportions of motifs in intergenic L1 were compared to the proportions within genes. As before, the values were normalized by the total number of elements in the respective region prior to comparison versus intergenic L1. Contrary to the pattern seen with Alu, L1 showed no trend of enrichment based on the placement within the gene. Instead the sequence of the motif had a significant effect on the proportion of motifs (p$_{placement}$ = 0.78; p$_{sequence}$ < 3.56e-13). Furthermore, unlike Alu, all motifs within L1 were reduced in genes compared to intergenically. SRY was the motif with the largest depletion within genes compared to L1 in intergenic regions (table \ref{table:sry}).

These results indicated that the sequence of both Alu and L1 were differentially maintained in genes versus intergenically. Binding motifs contained within Alu were reduced in a pattern similar to the distribution of the whole elements. Conversely, binding motifs within L1 were reduced depending on the sequence of the motif.

The previous analysis examined the distribution of binding motifs within human genes and indicate a general decrease of RT-contained motifs within genes. This lack of motifs in genes could have occured due to base-wise mutations of the motifs over time, or to a selection against elements as a whole. It was therefore important to analyze the base-wise conservation status of binding motifs which were differentially represented based on genomic context.

Conservation values used in this analysis were derived from the phyloP basewise conservation scores, where positive values indicated evidence of positive selection, and negative values indicated evidence of purifying selection. Importantly, conservation was only calculated within regions that matched the binding motif within the human reference sequence. Therefore, as opposed to the previous analysis which modeled the loss of binding motifs in the human reference, this calculation analyzed the individual basepairs within motifs that were present in humans but potentially lost in non-human primates.

Polyadenylation sequences were the first motif analyzed since they were present within both Alu and L1 consensus sequences, and were reduced within genes compared to intergenic regions. Basewise conservation scores were averaged for each base within the polyadenylation sequence of either L1 (figure \ref{fig:l1polyA}) or Alu (figure \ref{fig:alupolyA}). L1 and Alu elements were first separated into AS and S elements before conservation scores were calculated. Interestingly, both Alu and L1 showed a decrease in conservation at the central T base. Moreover, polyadenylation signals of L1 in the sense orientation had a lower conservation score on average than those of AS oriented L1.

Conservation of the Alu-specific Pol-III A-box (figure \ref{fig: alupol3}) was also examined in both the AS and S orientations. The Pol-III A-box is required for transcription and retrotransposition of Alu. When normalized versus intergenic values, there was no major difference between AS and S conservation signals, similar to what was observed for the polyadenylation signal within Alu.

There are four CpGs within the Pol-III A-box consensus sequence. The cytosine within a CpG context is more likely to undergo mutation than other nucleotides due to the common deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Surprisingly, only one of the four CpGs present within the queried sequence (position 20) was less conserved than the same position intergenically. Two bp in the Pol-III sequence were more highly conserved within genes than intergenically. These were the cytosine at position 3 and guanine at position 15.

These results indicated that each position within a RT-contained binding motif had a different expectation of conservation. Interestingly, the polyadenylation sequence, had a similar dynamic of conservation  independent of the element within which it resided. Moreover, the S L1 had a complete reduction of the polyadenylation signal, whereas the AS L1, S Alu, and AS Alu all had reductions only in the central thymine. This indicated that S polyadenylation signals may be strongly purified from within genes. Evidence in the literature that S L1 contribute to pre-mature polyadenylation substantiates this hypothesis \citep{Kaer2011}.

\subsection{Functional Binding Motifs Effect Maintenance, Tissue Specific}
Lastly, it was determined how the RT-specific variable of binding motifs was effected by the gene-specific variable of tissue-specific gene expression. To reduce the number of statistical tests, analysis was restricted to the deciles that contained the extremes of Alu and L1 frequency. These were deciles 2 and 9, otherwise defined as the first and last bins within the linear range of Alu/L1 frequency (section \ref{sec:as_dec}). To correct for differences in overall abundance of RTs depending on placement, motif frequencies were normalized by the count of AS or S elements within the respective bin. This was repeated separately for tissue-specific (TS) genes and house-keeping (HK) genes.

Since there was no normalization against intergenic in this analysis, the changes in proportion due to each motif was observable for this analysis (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs_tshk}). The proportion of motifs in each placement within TS genes were compared to the counterpart in HK genes. In general proportions of motifs in TS genes were larger than HK genes (87 of 140). 29 of the 140 comparisons were significant after Bonferonni correction ($\alpha$ = 3.6e-04) (figure \ref{fig:alumotifs_tshk}). Many of these comparisons were from polyadenylation sequences (N = 5 of 7 possible), and LUN1 (N = 4 of 7 possible). The majority of the significant comparisons were derived from whole gene comparisons (10 of 29 tests).

The majority of the significant comparisons were within polyadenylation sequences (N = 7 of 7 possible), and the second variation of RUNX3 (N$_{b}$ = 6 of 7 possible).
