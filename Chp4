\begin{tightcenter}CHAPTER 4\\ RETROTRANSPOSONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A SEX-SPECIFIC DECREASE IN GENE EXPRESSION \end{tightcenter}


%Purpose
    \textnormal\Large\textit{\\Purpose\\}
Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process necessary for the proper function of an organism. Despite conserved mechanisms regulating expression, many genes are highly variable between species \cite{Brawand2011, Carninci2005, Levine2003, Su2002}, between humans \cite{Cheung2003, Storey2007, Wang2008}, and between sexes \cite{Rinn2005, Trabzuni2013}. Variations in expression often correlate with measurable phenotype changes such as dopamine receptor expression and locomotor activity in mice \cite{Chesler2005}. Transcriptome differences associated with disease status further substantiate the hypothesis that gene expression is a key regulator of downstream phenotypes \cite{Su2002, Voineagu2011}. It is important to determine the underlying factors involved in gene expression variability to understand the plasticity of expression in unaffected individuals, as well as the limits of regulation, that when breached lead to disease. 

Large-scale genome-wide analyses such as those published by the ENCODE project have described many of the organizing components of genes underlying expression variance \cite{Birney2007, Dong2012, Wang2012}. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin folding are all examples of coordinating components of transcriptional regulation \cite{Bird2002, Jenuwein2001}. Although many genetic components, such as these, have been tested for correlation with transcription, much of the repetitive content of the genome remains unexamined for its link with expression. Specifically, retrotransposons (RT) have yet to be characterized for their association with gene expression, even though they account for approximately 40\% of the mass of the human genome \cite{Lander2001}. 

Three common families of RTs exist in high copy numbers in the human genome: L1, Alu, and SVA \cite{Lander2001}. These elements have successfully amplified in humans through the “copy and paste” method of retrotransposition \cite{Ostertag2001}. A subset of L1, Alu, and SVA remain mobile, with new Alu elements inserting at a rate of 1 in 20 generations \cite{Cordaux2006}, L1 at a rate of 1:95 – 1:270 generations \cite{Ewing2010}, and SVA approximated at a rate of 1:916 generations \cite{Xing2009}. Previous studies have attempted to annotate these differences, and have so far identified more than 5,000 polymorphic RT insertions between humans \cite{Stewart2011, Jianxin2006}. There are likely to be many more segregating RT locations between individuals due to current limited means of detection. The phenotypic effects of these polymorphic RTs have yet to be identified. There are indications of functional impact of RTs on genes. For example, RT show signs of selection resulting in an antisense bias within genes \cite{Linker2013, Stewart2011, Zhang2011}. Furthermore, when RTs insert into introns, there is a potential for functional change to the gene. For example, polyadenylation signals within L1 sequences are associated with premature truncation of protein coding genes that they are embedded within \cite{Belancio2008, Kaer2011}. Also, the presence of an L1 decreases expression of an upstream GFP, potentially due to a decreased processivity through the low complexity A-rich regions of the L1 \cite{Wang2009}. 

Despite indications that RTs can have an effect on gene function, they are largely understudied due to inherent complications in identifying locations of polymorphic insertions. Recent advances in both sequencing technology and alignment algorithms have increased the reliability of identifying specific locations of RT insertions \cite{Baillie2011, Beck2010, Ewing2010, Iskow2010, Stewart2011, Ye2009}. As of yet, there have only been a few genome-wide studies comparing the presence of RTs with associated gene expression levels. Most importantly, Arora et al., identified that genes that are differentially expressed between humans and chimps are enriched for genes that contain RT-containing indels \cite{Arora2011}. Here, we examined the association between the presence of RTs and gene expression changes in two scenarios. We examined the relationship both between humans and a subset of non-human primates, and continue the analysis between humans positive for RT insertions and humans negative for RT insertions. Our results suggest a common association between the presence of RTs and a decrease in expression of cis-genes in a sex-specific manner.

Using data from Brawand et al. (see methods), we obtained expression values for orthologous genes in human (hg19), chimp (panTro4), gorilla (GorGor3), orangutan (ponAbe2), and rhesus macaque (rheMac3). This dataset contained expression for multiple tissues, including brain, heart, kidney, liver, and testis. Locations of mobile element insertions (MEI) between humans and the respective non-human primate (NHP) were determined using mobile element annotation for each respective reference genome \cite{Kent2002}. MEI being Alu, L1, and SVA. Genes were classified as containing and MEI if the MEI was within the gene transcription start to transcription stop sites. In order to compare between the sexes, only genes on the autosomes were considered in this analysis. The sample sizes of MEI-containing genes identified for each primate are tabulated in table ref\{table:mei}.

The differences in expression across all species were controlled for by inter-sample normalization procedures (Brawand et al., 2011). Comparing between genes with MEIs versus genes without MEIs further controlled for differences in expression present across all genes. To determine if the presence of an MEI was associated with a general shift in gene expression, the odds of increased expression in humans for genes containing MEIs versus genes not containing MEIs were calculated using the contingency table in (table \ref{table:contablemei}). ORs were calculated between human and each NHP for each tissue, MEI sub-type, and males and females separately (Appendix X).

Female humans were missing expression values for testis and liver; these tissues were therefore excluded from analysis in females. To minimize type I error, p-values were calculated directly by permuting MEI-status and a Bonferroni cutoff was calculated based on the total number of tests across all MEI types (Number of OR tests = 96; Bonferroni cutoff p = 5.21e-04) (table \ref{table:permOR}). Many ORs associated with Alu remained significant after Bonferroni correction (Alu: 16 of 32 ORs) (figure \ref{fig:meiplots}), indicating a tendency for gene expression to shift between species depending on MEI status. L1 and SVA ORs also showed significant results (L1: 2 of 32 ORs; SVA: 11 of 32 ORs).

Although it is possible that L1 and SVA are less often associated with genes that are expressed lower in humans than Alu, it is also possible that the reduced number of significant tests is due to a lack of power to detect significance due to their small sample numbers (req. effect size, Alu Chimp: 0.08; req. effect size, L1 Chimp: 0.48; req. effect size, SVA Chimp: 0.23). Interestingly, 76\% of the significant ORs were < 1 (Alu: 11 of 16 sig. tests (69\%); L1: 2 of 2 sig. tests (100\%); SVA: 9 of 11 sig. tests (82\%)), indicating an association of decreased gene expression in humans with the presence of an MEI.

Volcano plots of ORs versus significance for all primates and tissues are presented in figures 1c-e. A substantial portion of the ORs were < 1 (Alu: 9 of 13 sig. tests; L1: 1 of 1 sig. tests; SVA: 6 of 7 sig. tests), indicating a tendency for gene expression to be decreased in humans when a MEI was present in human and not in the respective NHP. Figures showing the odds ratios for each test are presented in figure 2a-f.

\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{4.1.2 } Males show a stronger association between MEI status and expression in humans when compared to females}

Using ANOVA, all variables were examined to determine which had the largest effect on OR (sex, primate comparison, tissue, or MEI-type) (table 2). OR for the tissues testis and liver were removed due to the lack of data in female samples. Sex of the individual (p < 5.2e-04) showed the most significant effect on OR. Indeed when grouping significant ORs based on sex, a majority of the significant ORs were derived from male samples (21/29 = 72\%) as opposed to female samples (8/29 = 28\%). The direction of effect (i.e.: increased versus decreased expression in humans versus NHP) was also associated with the sex of the individual in genes containing MEIs. ORs were more often < 1 (decreased expression) in male samples (19/21 = 90\%) compared to female samples (3/8 = 38\%). Overall the odds ratios between males were significantly smaller than those between females (figure 2).

\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{4.2 } Mobile element insertions that are polymorphic between humans}

\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{4.2.1 } Genes containing MEI-Alu are differentially expressed between male and female humans}
The bias in OR due to the sex of the individual indicated that there was a bias in gene expression between males and females that was restricted to genes containing MEIs.  We next determined if the expression differences between humans and NHPs were also present as differences in expression between male and female humans. To test the differences between humans based on sex, we calculated expression within MEI genes in humans only and compared expression values between females and males of the same sex (figure 1b). MEIs were restricted to those derived from Alu (MEI-Alu) and were present in human but absent in all other NHP (equivalent to MEI-Alu, Chimp). To restrict the number of tests we only examined expression in the brain. Indeed, gene expression was more likely to be decreased in human males compared to human females when an MEI-Alu, Chimp was present within the gene (OR = 0.42; CI 95\% = 0.33 – 0.52; Fisher’s p  < 4.25 e-18). 

Although these results indicate that there is a sex-dependent difference in expression in genes containing an MEI; it is possible that we were detecting an unrelated bias in the dataset due to the small sample size (N male = 3, N female = 2). We examined a larger replication set to test the claim that the MEI gene set is significantly associated with genes that are differentially expressed between males and females. Trabzuni et al. characterized gene expression from human male (N=101) and female (N=36) brain and spinal cord tissues (Trabzuni et al., 2013). We analyzed the top differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes between males and females that were reported in this dataset. To facilitate the comparison MEI-Alu, Chimp were converted from Ensembl annotation to HUGO gene annotation (N MEI –Alu converted = 2200). Of the 442 genes differentially expressed or spliced between the sexes in any brain region, 117 contained an MEI-Alu, Chimp. This was significantly more genes containing MEI Alu than expected by chance (OR= 2.8; CI 95\% = 2.29 – 3.57;  Fisher’s exact p < 2.2e-16). Total gene count was set at 19116 to reflect the number of genes uniquely annotated in HUGO (Flicek et al., 2013; Kent et al., 2002). 

\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{4.2.2 } MEIs segregating in humans are associated with a decrease in expression}

Alu, L1, and SVA are retrotranspositionally competent in humans resulting in mobile element variation within the human population (Ewing & Kazazian, 2010; Stewart et al., 2011). Stewart et al. annotated a subset of MEIs that are polymorphic between humans. We next wanted to check if MEI-Alu locations that are segregating (MEI-seg) within the human population have a similar association with a change in gene expression as the MEIs previously identified between humans and primates. MEI-segs were identified from the CEU individuals typed in the 1000 genomes project (Stewart et al.). Expression data for the same CEU individuals was available from the Montgomery et al. dataset. Gene expression from Montgomery et al. was filtered to include only genes that contained an MEI-seg between the transcription start and transcription stop sites. 547 genes matched this criterion. Gene expression was compared between males and females containing MEI-seg (MEI-seg(+)). 338 genes (62\% of total, Z-test p < 3.8e-08) had a decrease in mean expression in males versus females (figure 3a.). Conversely when the same genes were compared between males and females without an MEI-seg (MEI-seg(-)), only 266 genes were decreased in males versus females (49\% of total, Z-test p < 0.64) (figure 3b). A Student’s t-test showed that this decrease in expression in MEI-seg(+) individuals was significantly larger than in MEI-seg(-) individuals (mean difexp log MEI-seg(+) = 0.009; mean difexp log MEI-seg(-) = -0.002; Student’s t-test p < 1.87 e-25) (figure 4). 


\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{4.2.3 } Decrease in expression in the presence of an MEI-seg is specific to males}

We next compared expression values within each sex group to determine if the effect was biased towards a decrease in males, or an increase of expression in females. The odds of decreased expression in the presence of an MEI-seg were significantly increased when the individual was male compared to female (OR = 2.36; CI 95\% = 1.84 – 3.05; Fisher’s exact p < 5.90e-12). Furthermore, the differential expression between MEI-seg(+) and MEI-seg (-) males was significantly greater than that between females (Student’s t-test  p < 7.93e-26) (fig 6). These results indicate that the bias of decreased expression was largely driven by MEI-associated expression in males. 

\textnormal\large\textit{\\\textnormal{4.2.4 } Genes containing MEI are functionally enriched for Autism susceptibility genes}

The genes contained an MEI-Alu, Chimp were tested for functional pathway enrichment. Splice variants were significantly enriched in this group (N = 1199, Benjamini corrected p < 4.1e-71), as well as neuron projection development (N = 54, Benjamini corrected p < 7.7e-04), brain expression (N = 1137, Benjamini corrected p < 9.2e-36), and phosphatidylinositol signaling (N = 19, Benjamini corrected p < 9.4e-02). The complete list is presented in supplementary table 2. 

Baillie et al. previously showed that there is somatic retrotransposition in the human brain (Baillie et al., 2011). Within the list of genes that were deemed somatic inserts in Baillie et al., we found that there was a significant overlap with genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Hussman et al., 2011) (OR = 7.29; CI 95\% = 5.01 – 10.73 ; Fisher’s exact p < 6.59e-27) (Supplementary table 2). We therefore performed an additional functional enrichment test to determine if genes containing MEI were enriched for genes related to ASD. MEI-Alu, Chimp were enriched for ASD genes. ASD genes were annotated using the Autism Database (AUTdb) (Basu, Kollu, & Banerjee-Basu, 2009). ASD genes were significantly enriched for genes containing MEI-Alu, Chimp (OR = 1.83; CI 95\% = 1.12 – 2.90; Fisher’s exact p < 0.01). More strikingly, ASD genes were significantly enriched within genes containing the human polymorphic MEI-segs (OR = 5.10; CI 95\% = 3.48 – 7.41; Fisher’s exact p < 6.09e-16). 

Similar to all MEI-seg genes, the ASD genes containing an MEI-seg showed sex-specific differences in expression. Differences in expression between MEI-seg (+) and MEI-seg (-) males were significantly greater than between MEI-seg (+) versus MEI-seg (-) females (mean dif logExp male = -0.008; mean dif logExp female = -0.002 ; Student’s p < 0.04) (figure 5b).
