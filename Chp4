\chapter{\\RETROTRANSPOSONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A SEX-SPECIFIC DECREASE IN GENE EXPRESSION}

Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process necessary for the proper function of an organism. Despite conserved mechanisms regulating expression, many genes are highly variable between species \citep{Brawand2011, Carninci2005, Levine2003, Su2002}, between humans \citep{Cheung2003, Storey2007, Wang2008}, and between sexes \citep{Rinn2005, Trabzuni2013}. Variations in expression are often correlated with measurable phenotypic changes such as dopamine receptor expression and locomotor activity in mice \citep{Chesler2005}. Transcriptome differences associated with disease status further indicate that gene expression is a key regulator of downstream phenotypes \citep{Su2002, Voineagu2011}. It is important to determine the underlying factors involved in gene expression variability to understand the plasticity of expression in unaffected individuals, as well as the limits of regulation, that when breached lead to disease. 

Large-scale genome-wide analyses such as those published by the ENCODE project have described many of the organizing components of genes underlying expression variance \citep{Birney2007, Dong2012, Wang2012}. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin folding are all examples of coordinating components of transcriptional regulation \citep{Bird2002, Jenuwein2001}. Although many genetic components, such as these, have been tested for correlation with transcription, much of the repetitive content of the genome remains unexamined for its link with expression. Specifically, retrotransposons (RT) have yet to be characterized for their association with gene expression, even though they account for approximately 40\% of the mass of the human genome \citep{Lander2001}. 

Despite indications that RTs can have an effect on gene function, they are largely understudied due to inherent complications in identifying locations of polymorphic insertions. Recent advances in both sequencing technology and alignment algorithms have increased the reliability of identifying specific locations of RT insertions \citep{Baillie2011, Beck2010, Ewing2010, Iskow2010, Stewart2011, Ye2009}. As of yet, there have only been a few genome-wide studies comparing the presence of RTs with associated gene expression levels. Most importantly, Arora et al., identified that genes that are differentially expressed between humans and chimps are enriched for genes that contain RT-containing indels \citep{Arora2011}. 

In this chapter, the association between the presence of RTs and gene expression was examined. RTs were identified as either polymorphic between humans and a subset of non-human primates, or as polymorphic between human individuals. Expression data was then analyzed in these genes to determine if there was an association of RT polymorphisms with differential gene expression.

\section{Mobile Element Insertions between Humans and Non-human Primates}
Mobile elements, specifically retrotransposons (RTs), have the potential to effect gene expression. For example RTs often contain transcription factor binding motifs that recruit protein complexes, and offset levels of gene expression. Due to limitations of current methods to identify RT insertions, the association of RTs with gene expression has remained understudied. It is important to determine whether RTs have a predictable effect on gene expression, since they are a major cause of genotypic variation. If RTs indeed contribute to changes in gene expression, then the variability of RTs between humans can be influencing the phenotypic variabilty in the population.

To determine if retrotransposons (RTs) effect the phenotype of gene expression, insertions were tested for association with gene expression. The first class of data in which this was tested was in genes that contained a RT in humans but that were absent in a reference genome of non-human primates. Since there are many other variables that can be associated with changes in gene expression between humans and non-human primates, other than RTs, the tests of association used genes without insertions to control for inter-species differences.

\label{table:mei}
\end{table}

Genes were first identified that contained mobile element insertions (MEIs) of either L1, Alu, or SVA.  These genes were then filtered to retain only genes with orthologs between human (hg19), chimp (panTro4), gorilla (GorGor3), orangutan (ponAbe2), and rhesus macaque (rheMac3). Locations of MEIs between humans and the respective non-human primate (NHP) were determined using mobile element annotation for each respective reference genome \citep{Kent2002}. Genes were classified as an MEI-containing gene if the MEI was within the gene transcription start to transcription stop sites, including introns. In order to compare between the sexes, only genes on the autosomes were considered in this analysis. Using data from Brawand et al., expression values were obtained for all of these genes and for each species. This dataset contained expression for multiple tissues, including brain, heart, kidney, liver, and testis.  The sample sizes of MEI-containing genes identified for each primate, and those with expression values from Brawand et al., were tabulated in table \ref{table:mei}.




The differences in expression across all species were controlled for by inter-sample normalization procedures (Brawand et al., 2011). Comparing between genes with MEIs versus genes without MEIs further controlled for differences in expression present across all genes. To determine if the presence of an MEI was associated with a general shift in gene expression, the odds ratio (OR) of increased expression in humans for genes containing MEIs versus genes not containing MEIs were calculated using the contingency table presented in table \ref{table:contablemei}. These ORs were calculated between human and each NHP for each tissue, MEI sub-type, and males and females separately (table \ref{table:permOR}).

Female humans were missing expression values for testis and liver; these tissues were therefore excluded from analysis in females. To minimize type I error, p-values were calculated directly by permuting MEI-status and a strict Bonferroni cutoff was calculated based on the total number of tests across all MEI types (Number of OR tests = 96; Bonferroni cutoff p = 5.21e-04) (table \ref{table:permOR}). Many ORs associated with Alu remained significant after Bonferroni correction (Alu: 16 of 32 ORs) (figure \ref{fig:meiplots}), indicating a tendency for gene expression to shift between species associated with MEI status. L1 and SVA ORs also showed significant results (L1: 1 of 32 ORs; SVA: 10 of 32 ORs).

    \end{figure}

Although it is possible that L1 and SVA are less often associated with genes that are expressed lower in humans than Alu, it is also possible that the reduced number of significant tests is due to a lack of power to detect significance due to their small sample numbers (req. effect size, Alu Chimp: 0.08; req. effect size, L1 Chimp: 0.48; req. effect size, SVA Chimp: 0.23). Interestingly, 76\% of the significant ORs were < 1 (Alu: 11 of 16 sig. tests (69\%); L1: 1 of 1 sig. tests (100\%); SVA: 8 of 11 sig. tests (72\%)), indicating an association of decreased gene expression in humans with the presence of an MEI.

\subsection{Males Show a Stronger Association between MEI Status and Expression in Humans when Compared to Females}

There were four variables that were uncontrolled for in the calculation of odds ratio: sex of the individual, non-human primate species, tissue of origin, and MEI-type. It was therefore important to determine if any of these variables had a significant effect on the outcome of odds ratio. To compare the effects of each variable type, ORs were regressed on sex, NHP, tissue, and mei (equation \ref{spec}).

 %Linear Regression Equation: variables
    \begin{equation}
    \label{spec}
        Odds Ratio  = \beta _{o} + \beta sex + \beta NHP  + \beta tissue + \beta MEI  + \epsilon
    \end{equation}

These models were compared using a four-way ANOVA. Using ANOVA, all variables were examined to determine which had the largest effect on OR (sex, primate comparison, tissue, or MEI-type) (table \ref{table:anova}). OR for the tissues testis and liver were removed due to the lack of data in female samples. Sex of the individual (p < 5.2e-04) showed the most significant effect on OR.

Indeed when grouping significant ORs based on sex, a majority of the significant ORs were derived from male samples (20/27 = 74\%) as opposed to female samples (7/27 = 26\%). The direction of effect (i.e.: increased versus decreased expression in humans versus NHP) was also associated with the sex of the individual in genes containing MEIs. ORs were more often < 1 (decreased expression) in male samples (18/20 = 90\%) compared to female samples (2/7 = 28\%). Overall the odds ratios between males were significantly smaller than those between females (figure \ref{fig:malefemale}).

\section{Mobile Element Insertions that are Polymorphic Between Humans}

\subsection{Genes containing MEI-Alu are differentially expressed between male and female humans}
The bias in OR due to the sex of the individual indicated that there was a bias in gene expression between males and females that was restricted to genes containing MEIs.  It was next determined if the expression differences between humans and NHPs were also present as differences in expression between male and female humans. To test the differences between humans based on sex, expression was calculated within MEI genes in humans only and compared expression values between females and males of the same sex (table \ref{table:contablesex}).

MEIs were restricted to those derived from Alu (MEI-Alu) and were present in human but absent in all other NHP (equivalent to MEI-Alu-Chimp). To restrict the number of tests expression was only examined in the brain. Indeed, gene expression was more likely to be decreased in human males compared to human females when an MEI-Alu-Chimp was present within the gene (OR = 0.42; CI 95\% = 0.33 -- 0.52; Fisher\rq s p  < 4.25 e-18). 

Although these results indicated that there was a sex-dependent difference in expression in genes containing an MEI; it was possible that the analysis detected an unrelated bias in the dataset due to the small sample size (N male = 3, N female = 2). Therefore, a larger replication set was examined. This larger dataset was used to test the claim that the MEI gene set was significantly associated with genes that were differentially expressed between males and females.

Trabzuni et al. characterized gene expression from human male (N=101) and female (N=36) brain and spinal cord tissues \citep{Trabzuni2013}. The top differentially expressed and alternatively spliced genes between males and females that were reported in this dataset were used for this analysis. To facilitate the comparison, MEI-Alu-Chimp were converted from Ensembl annotation to HUGO gene annotation (N MEI-Alu-Chimp converted = 2200). Of the 442 genes differentially expressed or spliced between the sexes in any brain region, 117 contained an MEI-Alu-Chimp. This was significantly more genes containing MEI-Alu-Chimp than expected by chance (OR= 2.8; CI 95\% = 2.29 -- 3.57;  Fisher\rq s exact p < 2.2e-16). Total gene count was set at 19116 to reflect the number of genes uniquely annotated in HUGO \citep{Flicek2013, Kent2002}. 

\subsection{MEIs segregating in humans are associated with a decrease in expression}

Alu, L1, and SVA are retrotranspositionally competent in humans resulting in mobile element variation within the human population \citep{Ewing2010, Stewart2011}. Stewart et al. annotated a subset of MEIs that are polymorphic between humans. It was next important to check if MEI-Alu locations that were segregating (MEI-seg) within the human population had a similar association with a change in gene expression as the MEIs previously identified between humans and primates. MEI-segs were identified from the CEU individuals typed in the 1000 genomes project. Expression data for the same CEU individuals was available from the Montgomery et al. dataset. Gene expression from Montgomery et al. was filtered to include only genes that contained an MEI-seg between the transcription start and transcription stop sites. 547 genes matched this criterion. Gene expression was compared between males and females containing MEI-seg (MEI-seg(+)). 338 genes (62\% of total, Z-test p < 3.8e-08) had a decrease in mean expression in males versus females (figure \ref{fig:femalemalecase}). Conversely when the same genes were compared between males and females without an MEI-seg (MEI-seg(-)), only 266 genes were decreased in males versus females (49\% of total, Z-test p < 0.64) (figure \ref{fig:femalemalecontrol}). A Student\rq s t-test showed that this decrease in expression in MEI-seg(+) individuals was significantly larger than in MEI-seg(-) individuals (mean difexp log MEI-seg(+) = 0.009; mean difexp log MEI-seg(-) = -0.002; Student\rq s t-test p < 1.87 e-25).

\subsection{Decrease in expression in the presence of an MEI-seg is specific to males}

Expression values were compared within each sex group to determine if the effect was biased towards a decrease in males, or an increase of expression in females. The odds of decreased expression in the presence of an MEI-seg were significantly increased when the individual was male compared to female (OR = 2.36; CI 95\% = 1.84 -- 3.05; Fisher\rq s exact p < 5.90e-12). Furthermore, the differential expression between MEI-seg(+) and MEI-seg (-) males was significantly greater than that between females (Student\rq s t-test  p < 7.93e-26) (figure \ref{fig:malemale_femfem}). These results indicated that the bias of decreased expression was largely driven by MEI-associated expression in males.

\subsection{Genes containing MEI are functionally enriched for Autism susceptibility genes}

The genes contained an MEI-Alu, Chimp were tested for functional pathway enrichment. Splice variants were significantly enriched in this group (N = 1199, Benjamini corrected p < 4.1e-71), as well as neuron projection development (N = 54, Benjamini corrected p < 7.7e-04), brain expression (N = 1137, Benjamini corrected p < 9.2e-36), and phosphatidylinositol signaling (N = 19, Benjamini corrected p < 9.4e-02). The complete list is presented in supplementary table 2. 

Baillie et al. previously showed that there is somatic retrotransposition in the human brain (Baillie et al., 2011). Within the list of genes that were deemed somatic inserts in Baillie et al., there was a significant overlap with genes associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Hussman et al., 2011) (OR = 7.29; CI 95\% = 5.01 -- 10.73 ; Fisher\rq s exact p < 6.59e-27) (Supplementary table 2).  Therefore an additional functional enrichment test was performed to determine if genes containing MEI were enriched for genes related to ASD. MEI-Alu, Chimp were enriched for ASD genes. ASD genes were annotated using the Autism Database (AUTdb) \citep{Basu2009}. ASD genes were significantly enriched for genes containing MEI-Alu, Chimp (OR = 1.83; CI 95\% = 1.12 -- 2.90; Fisher\rq s exact p < 0.01). More strikingly, ASD genes were significantly enriched within genes containing the human polymorphic MEI-segs (OR = 5.10; CI 95\% = 3.48 -- 7.41; Fisher\rq s exact p < 6.09e-16). 

Similar to all MEI-seg genes, the ASD genes containing an MEI-seg showed sex-specific differences in expression. Differences in expression between MEI-seg (+) and MEI-seg (-) males were significantly greater than between MEI-seg (+) versus MEI-seg (-) females (mean dif logExp male = -0.008; mean dif logExp female = -0.002 ; Student\rq s p < 0.04) (figure 5b).
