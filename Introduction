        \hspace{20pt}Non-coding mobile genetic elements have the potential to alter the regulation of genes. Gene expression regulation is an evolutionary conserved process that responds to complex cues such as tissue-type, stage of development, and levels of cellular stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. As expected, changes in tissue-type, stage of development, and environmental cues require different genes to be expressed to properly manage the system. This process of regulating gene expression is multi-facted examples are: chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core processes involved in regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA of the following sequence: (5'-[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3'), where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs results in increased expression of the downstream gene.\\

        \hspace{20pt}Although the regulatory mechanisms are conserved, gene expression remains highly variable depending on the context of the cell. Tissue-specificity, temporal cues, and species differences are all examples of variables associated with differential gene expression.
