    \large\textit{\hspace*{185pt}\\...Seeing the common, everyday thing in this new light I was often transfixed. The moment one gives close attention to anything, even a blade of grass, it becomes a mysterious, awesome, indescribable magnified world in itself. Almost an unrecognizable world. The writer waits in ambush for these unique moments. He pounces on his little grain of nothingness like a beast of prey. It is the moment of full awakening, of union and absorption, and it can never be forced.\\\\

The genome of almost every species presently studied contains discrete DNA elements capable of mobilizing and transpositioning into new genomic locations. These mobile elements are larger than the 1-20 bp of common SNPs and indels \cite{Mullaney2010}, and upon inserting into relatively vulnerable regions, can alter the stability of a gene. For example, when inserted into a conserved coding exon, a mobile element can disrupt the amino acid sequence fundamentally changing the final protein product. This was the case when an L1 retrotransposon inserted into the last exon of the tumor suppressor gene APC, triggering sporadic colorectal cancer \cite{Miki1992}. Future disease studies must be able to predict disruptions induced by mobile element insertions, similar to the now common practice of filtering on predicted effects of SNPs and indels. In the case of mobile elements, predicting disruptions is further complicated by the presence of protein binding sites contained within the sequence. These sites can impact a gene apart from the more obvious structural effects such as shifting the reading frame or increasing the size of the mRNA. Sequence motifs specific to mobile elements can induce functional changes by sequestering protein complexes such as chromatin remodellers, enhancers, and polymerases [REFs]. A long debated question in genetics is whether these attributes of mobile elements have a global effect on the genome or if they are instead largely neutral entities, with no observable benefit or detriment to the genome. Studies of the distribution of RTs within genes indicate that there is an unequal level of maintenance of RTs within genes, indicating that selection may be acting differentially on mobile elements based on genomic context. Though this indicates that there is a relationship between gene function and RTs, it is unknown what generalizable effects RTs have on genes. Here I present evidence of selective pressures shaping the RT distribution within genes, including the generalized effect of RTs on gene expression.

The genome responds to spatio-temporal and evironmental cues by regulating gene expression [REF], thereby coordinating tissue-type, stage of development, as well as responses to external stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. Regulating gene expression is a multi-facted process including chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, and post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core components of regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and enhancers, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA with the sequence: 5'-[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3', where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs can result in increased expression of the downstream gene. Other similar proteins may induce decreased expression[REF], alternative splicing [REF], or coordinated regulation with other genes [REF].

Aberrant regulation of gene expression is often associated with disease, and therefore many studies focus on the genetic determinants of altered gene expression. Variations associated with differential expression are termed expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Although these variants may occur within the coding region \cite{Delker2011}, they more commonly occur near transcription start sites and within  regulatory regions \cite{Veyrieras2008}. Despite there being many other forms of genetic variation, these eQTL studies generally examine small nucleotide variants, such as SNPs and small indels. Larger variations are often missed such as large structural rearrangements, copy number variations, and mobile element insertions. Importantly, it is these larger variations that track most with large scale changes in phenotype, such as the loss of conserved non-protein coding elements through deletions \cite{Hiller2012}. Moreover, chromosomes that have undergone large scale rearragments have a 2 fold faster protein evolution rate between humans and chimps \cite{Navarro2003}. and even differences between human and other non-human primates [].

The coding genome of humans and non-human primates (NHP) are highly similar, with humans and chimps differing by only 4\% of the protein-coding regions  \cite{Varki2005}. Despite the conservation of coding sequence, many phenotypes are distintive between the two species. For example, the structure of organs such as the salt-wasting kidneys, the immune response, and social organization are variable between humans and NHPs \cite{Varki2005}. Attempts to determine the genetic differences underlying these and other phenotypic changes have revealed that not only are protein-coding sequences highly similar [REFs], but 3’-UTRs also exhibit baseline mutation rates  \cite{Li2006, Wang2007}. Gene expression levels, however, are significantly different between NHPs and humans  \cite{Blekhman2002; Gilad2006}, indicating that the regulation of gene expression may play a underlying role in the development of larger phenotypic differences. 

An example of gene expression variability between humans and NHPs is exhibited on a tissue-specific level  \cite{Blekhman2008}. The highly specific structures such as [examples] of the brain have differences in expression between primate species  \cite{Khaitovich2004}. Furthermore, [x] and humans differentially express genes located within the chromosome 7 Autism susceptibility locus  \cite{Navarro2012, Schneider2012}. 

Since non-coding sequences, such as transcription factor binding sites, are important for coordinating regulation of gene expresion, it is likely that they also play a large role in species-specific differential expression. Indeed, genes that have increased in expression in humans versus non-human primates are enriched for transcription factors, indicating that this level of regulation plays an important role in the differences in gene variation between species \cite{Gilad2006}.

    %Insertion of Retrotransposons During Primate Evolution
    \textnormal\Large\textit{\\\\\num{1.4 } Active Retrotransposon Families in Primates\\}
    %Body of Text
%        \large{
 Recently, Arora et al. have shown that genes differentially expressed between human and chimp are significantly enriched for indels that contain retrotransposons (RT)  \cite{Arora2011}. RTs are Type I mobile DNA elements that integrate into the genome via an RNA intermediate [REF]. Sometimes this is referred to as a "copy and paste" mechanism, as opposed to Type II transposons that insert through a "cut and paste" mechanism. The important, and sometimes described as parasitic, advantage to Type I retrotransposition is that with each new insertion, the number of mobile elements in the host genome increases by one, thereby amplifying the number of RTs present in the genome. This method of amplification has resulted in retrotransposons making up almost 40\% of the current human genome. This is striking when considering the 1.5\% of the genome made up of protein-coding sequence (33\% when including introns) \cite{Lander2001}.

In primates there are three major families of RTs: LINE-1 (L1), Alu, and SVA. These can be split up into two groups, i.) autonomous RTs and ii.) non-autonomous RTs. Autonomous RTs encode a protein with both endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity \cite{Mathias1991,Feng1996}. Without autonomous elements, the non-autonomous elements would be immobile. The non-autonomous elements have an increased affinity to bind to the retrotransposition proteins, and are therefore able to be inserted even though they do not contain the protein machinery themselves. In the present mammalian genome, Long-autonomous INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is the most prevalent autonomous element  \cite{Feng1996,Mathias1991}. The full-length L1 is approximately 6 kilobases (kb) long and encodes two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) flanked by a promoter on the 5'-end and an A-rich tail on the 3'-end~\ref{fig:l1}  \cite{Scott1987}. The two coding regions are promoted by an Pol-II promoter located at the 5'-end of the L1 element. This promoter region is retaing during transcription, therby allowing full-length inserts to retain their functionality. The ORF2 product does most of the work in retrotransposition, encoding both the endonuclease and the reverese transcriptase [REF, is this true?]. ORF1 is advantageous, but not necessary, for the mobilization of non-autonomous elements. It is however required for the mobilization of L1. The majority of L1 do not get fully mobilized when re-inserted into the genome, this is termed 5'-trunction [REF]. Although L1 is present in all mammals currently studied, each species has a distinctive sequence of L1. L1 is subdivided into subfamilies based on these distinctions with the major classifications being L1M, L1P, and L1Hs. The 5'-region of the human specific L1 is less conserved and contains regions with higher GC-content and with homology to the non-autonomous RT Alu \cite{Scott1987}.

Alu is a non-autonomous RT that has suceeded in hitchiking on the retrotransposition abilities of L1 to expand to millions of copies in the human genome \cite{Lander2001}. The origin sequence of Alu is thought to be from the 7SL-RNA (figure\ref{fig:alu_line}). 7SL is an integral component of the signal recognition particle, trafficing secretory proteins through the ER \cite{Gundelfinger1984}. It is thought that 7SL duplicated into a pseudogene called the fossil Alu monomer (FAM) \cite{Quentin1992}. FAM then underwent mutations, and subsequently amplfied as the left and right monomeric ancestors of Alu, FLAM and FRAM \cite{Quentin1992}. Eventually FLAM and FRAM were joined into a dimer by a central A-rich region which is the common ancestor of the modern Alu \cite{Quentin1992a}. Presently Alu is subdivided into subfamilies based on diagnostic mutations in the consensus sequence \cite{Batzer2002}. The oldest subfamily is AluJ, followed by AluS, and finally AluY.  

SVA is a composite element that contains regions with similarity to Alu and the human endogenous retrovirus (hERV), as well as a variable number tandem repeat region [REF]. [More info here.]

            %Process of Retrotransposition
    \textnormal\Large\textit{\\\\\num{1.5 } The Process of Retrotransposition\\}
%    \large{
Alu, L1, and SVA are mobilized through the process of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) \cite{Raiz2011,Dewannieux2003,Ostertag2001}. TPRT is a method of retrotransposition, meaning that it involves an RNA-intermediate, as opposed to the cut-and-paste methods of transposition that are restricted to DNA. In humans the enzymes that carry out TPRT are encoded by the L1 retrotransposon. The process begins by the transcription of the ORF1 and ORF2 components of full-length L1. ORF2p is required for integration of L1, however it is not necessary, but enhances, the integration of Alu \cite{Wallace2008}. Alu and L1 must also be transcribed for the process of TPRT to occur. It has been hypothesized that RNA transcribed by Pol-III is integrated more quickly than Pol-II \cite{Kroutter2009}. Indeed Alu, which are transcribed by Pol-III, integrate at higher rates than that of L1, which is transcribed by Pol-II. Upon transcription of the retrotransposon RNA, the RNA is shuttled out of the nucleus where it forms an ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with the L1 ORF1p and ORF2p \cite{Docuet2001,Hohjoh1996,Kulpa2005}. A number of host factors are also be present in this RNP that contribute to mobilization. For example, PABPC1, MOV10, UPF1, and PCNA have all been identified in associated with L1 RNPs \cite{Taylor2013}. A subset of these proteins repress retrotransposition, such as MOV10 \cite{Arjan-Odedra2012}, while some of them enhance it. PABPC1 is protein that enhances retrotransposition through binding the polyadenosine (polyA) tail of mRNAs \cite{Campo2009}. The knockdown of polyA binding proteins such as PABPC1 has been shown to reduce retrotransposition while retaining the transcription and translation capacity of L1 \cite{Dai2012}. Interestingly, it has also been shown that retrotransposons with longer A-tails are more efficient at retrotransposition \cite{Comeaux2009}. 

Upon formation of the RNP, the complex is reintroduced into the nucleus. The process of insertion begins by the ORF2p cleaving a single stranded nick at the A-T phosphodiester bond in an 'AATTTT' motif \cite{Feng1996}. Although there are known hotspots of integration \cite{Wimmer2011}, it is still hypothesized that the selection of the 'AATTTT' motif is random \cite{Ovchinnikov2001}. After the first strand is nicked, the stretch of adenosine nucelotides at the end of the mobilized RNA hybridizes to the 'TTTT's of the nicked DNA. Reverse transcription begins from this primed region, copying the retrotransposon RNA into cDNA from the 3\rq-OH end of the 'TTTT'. The reverse transcription proceeds from this point. Alu are short, ~300bp elements, that are normally completely reverse transcribed. Full-length L1 however, are ~6kb in length, and the retrotransposition process does not always proceed until completion. The incomplete processing of L1 retrotransposons is termed "5\rq - transduction" and many of L1 in the human genome exist in this form at approximately 1kb in length. The conclusion of TPRT results in a duplication of the flanking DNA sequence, termed target-site duplications \cite{Kojima2010}. These regions are often used to validate whether an insertion is real, or whether it is false positive. In rare events, the process of TPRT is accompanied by structural rearrangements in the region. The link between retrotransposition and structural rearrangements will be discussed more in section 1.6(??????).

    The distribution of RTs in the current human genome can indicate signs of selection, or the effect that the RT is having on the organism. RTs insert in the human genome at a rate of approximately 1 in 20 births for Alu, 1 in 270 births for L1, and 1:916 births for SVA \cite{Cordaux2006,Ewing2010,Xing2009}. New polymorphic insertions, as noted by a lack of fixation in the population, are evenly distributed throughout the genome \cite{Stewart2011}, as are young L1 present in the reference genome \cite{Ovchinnikov2001}. These findings indicate that RTs are integrated without preference across the genome. Contradictory studies, however, have identified some transposition hotspots within the human genome. For example, NF1 is a hotspot for both Alu and L1 integration events, resulting in altered splicing of the NF1 gene \cite{Wimmer2011}. Furthermore, it has been shown that young RTs are commonly nested within older elements, indicating a potential presence of hotspots \cite{Levy2010}. Despite the limited findings of insertional hotspots, it is still accepted that RTs insert relatively randomly throughout the genome.
    
Conversely, RTs with long residence times in a population show a non-random distribution across the genome. This altered distribution is contrary to what would be expected under a neutral hypothesis of selection on RTs which would result in a relatively uniform distribution. Furthermore, Alu and L1 do not show the same trends of altered densities. Alu tend to be present in higher numbers in in GC-rich regions and to cluster with one another, whereas L1 are increased in GC-poor regions \cite{Pavlicek2001,Soriano1983}. There are a few hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this change in density over time. One theory suggests that segmental duplications mediated by Alu elements increases the co-clustering and enrichment of Alu in regions where Alu already exist \cite{Jurka2004}. Furthermore, this same model suggests that newly inserted Alu are removed at high rates, therefore reducing the Alu load in AT-rich regions. 


Aberrations in otherwise random distribution are signs of violations of Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium, such as local selection or genetic drift [REF]. The altered distributions of Alu and L1 indicate that there is a selective pressure acting on these RTs. Some groups suggest that RTs are undergoing purifying selection \cite{Jurka2004, Stewart2011}. One study examined the rate of heterozygosity of polymorphic RTs in various human populations. They found that Alu and L1 are present more often in the heterozygous state than the homozygous state \cite{Stewart2011}. This deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is similar to what would be expected under negative selection.

Another study attempting to determine the selective forces on RTs examined the densities of Alu on the autosomes, chrX, and chrY seperately. The advantage to this study was that each of these chromosome groups undergo varying selective forces. One example is that autosomes, chrX, and chrY have different effective population sizes. The equations below show the effetive population sizes for autosomes (equation \ref{eq:auto}), chrX (equation \ref{eq:chrx}), and chrY (equation \ref{eq:chry}), where N$_{\textit{e}}$ is effective population size, N\textit{m} is the population size of males, and N\textit{f} is the population size of females. [REF, Hartl and Clark Principles of human genetics]. 

    %Effective population size : Autosome
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{4N_{\textit{m}}N_{\textit{f}}}{N_{\textit{m}} + N_{\textit{f}}}
        \label{eq:auto}
    \end{equation}

    %Effective population size : ChrX
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{9N_{\textit{m}}N_{\textit{f}}}{4N_{\textit{m}} + 2N_{\textit{f}}}
        \label{eq:chrx}
    \end{equation}
    
    %Effective population size : ChrY
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{N_{\textit{m}}}{2}
         \label{eq:chry}
    \end{equation}


N$_{\textit{e}}$ (equation \ref{rfix}) is a key determinant in the ability for selection to act over genetic drift \cite{Charlesworth2009}, and therefore the forces of selection differ depending on the chromosome on which it is acting. Another factor at play in the difference of selection between chrX and chrY is the effect termed "Muller's ratchet" \cite{Muller1964}. Muller posited that recombination is highly important for purifying selection. This theory states that there is a lack of an ability to purify deleterious mutations from the genome, since the genome is inherited as a whole with each generation. The next generation then has a higher genetic load of deleterious mutations to begin with, and this mutational load is ever increasing. [MORE SENTENCES, SUPPORT FOR MULLER'S RATCHET ON CHRY]. Although many studies have shown that Muller's ratchet is truely acting on chrY, some studies have shown that there are regions of purifying selection \cite{Sayres2014}.

Jurka showed that there are signs of purifying selection of Alu on chrY \cite{Jurka2004}. Moreover, by comparing between chrX and the autosomes, they show signs of paternal selection against Alu [Any more papers on selection of Alu and L1??? Or even SVA??]

Understanding the factors associated with these observed distribution biases could help to predict the functional impact RT insertions. Furthermore, Studying the non-random distribution of RTs within genes will provide further evidence of the selectable interaction between RT and genomic context.   

The hypothesis that RTs undergo purifying selection within genes is still a topic that is debated in the literature [REFs].

        
        Previous studies have taken advantage of the high copy number of RTs to study the relationships of mobile elements with the host genome, revealing the capacity of various genomic contexts to withstand retrotransposition. There are 1.1e06, 9.5e05, and 3.7e03 Alu, L1, and SVA respectively annotated in the human Hg19 reference genome \cite{Kent2002}. Furthermore, the 1000 genomes project has identified [x,y,and z] Alu, L1, and SVA respectively that are segregating within humans. These segregating, or polymorphic RTs allow us to [b;a b;a b;a]. Within genes, certain regions are more susceptible to disruption by RTs than others \cite{Zhang2011}. The regions identified so far have been termed “hazardous zones,” and are highly correlated with exon density. Orientation of the RT with respect to the gene has also been determined to be an important factor in RT density.

    %Antisense Bias 
    \textnormal\Large\textit{\\\\\num{1.7 } Antisense Bias of RTs in Genes\\}
    %Body of Text
%        \large{
The non-random distribution of RTs is likely a result of a combination of variables such as the selection ceofficient of the mutation, the effective population size, and the rate of recombination in the region of the mutation. Interestingly, the distributions of RTs in genes differs depending on orientation of the RT with respect to the gene. Elements in the antisense orientation (AS) with respect to a gene are more common than elements that are oriented in the sense (S) direction, termed antisense bias \cite{VanDeLagemaat2006}. When in the same region, RTs in either orientation would be expected to be undergoing similar levels of genetic drift, effects of population size, and hitchiker effects.  The varying distribution is likely the result of either selection on the RT based on the orientation, or a bias due to TPRT. Antisense bias is observed across all major human RTs as well as Type II DNA transposons. Although this indicates that AS bias is not due to TPRT, since Type II transposons do not insert via TPRT, it is still unknown whether the antisense bias (AS bias) is due to the process of integration, or is due to a mechanism of selection over time.

 Retrotransposons have shaped the human genome throughout primate evolution, contributing to splice sites, coding sequence, and primate-specific enhancers [REF]. Although individual RTs accumulate mutations over time, they retain similarities to the parent RT until they have been completely mutated. The consensus sequences of the different parent RTs contain sequence motifs that can act as binding sites for transcription factors \cite{Polak2006}, polymerases \cite{Fuhrman1981,Minakami1992,Swergold1990}, polyadenylation enzymes \cite{Kaer2011}, and other  regulatory proteins. Therefore, when RTs integrate into a new location they may impact regulatory mechanisms as well as the protein coding regions of the gene. RT insertions can disrupt transcriptional regulation  \cite{Kaer2011,Speek2001,Matlik2006} and  chromatin structure \cite{Englander1995,Rebollo2011}. For example, Wang et al. showed that different fragments of the L1-ORF2 modulated transcription termination of upstream GFP expression \cite{Wang2009}, demonstrating functional impact of the L1 sequence on gene transcription without a direct disruption of coding sequence. The functional consequences of RT retrotransposition are not always deleterious, however, and in some instances they have led to the evolution of mammalian-specific \cite{Shephard2007} and human-specific traits \cite{Hayakawa2001}. On a genome-wide level, retrotransposition has been the source of novel coding sequences \cite{Yu2007}, chromatin organization \cite{Englander1995,Schmidt2012}, and tissue-specific regulation \cite{Robin1992} throughout mammalian evolution. While many of these insertions have no apparent pathological consequence, a subset are known to have deleterious effects [REF].\\

Herein I present an examination of the consequences of RT insertions within genes. This includes evidence showing that RT insertions are under selective pressure within genes, genetic factors modifying selection of RTs, and the association between RTs and differential expression of the genes they reside within. This research will aid future disease studies attempting to link genetic variability of RTs to phenotypic change by aiding the ability to annotate RT insertions as potentially deleterious based on variables such as genomic location and RT-type.
