        Non-coding mobile genetic elements have the potential to alter the regulation of genes. Regulation of gene expression is an evolutionary conserved process that is capable of responding to complex cues such as tissue-type, stage of development, and levels of cellular stress. These concerted signals act through interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. Regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, have evolved to bind to these predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to (5'-[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3'), which then increases expression of the coincident gene.
