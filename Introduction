    %The Dynamics of Regulating Gene Expression

        \hspace{20pt}Non-coding mobile genetic elements have the potential to alter the regulation of genes. Gene expression regulation is an evolutionary conserved process that responds to complex cues such as tissue-type, stage of development, and level of cellular stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. As expected, changes in tissue-type, stage of development, and environmental cues require different genes to be expressed to properly manage the organism as a whole. This process of regulating gene expression is multi-facted including contributions from chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, and post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core processes involved in regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA of the following sequence: (5'-[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3'), where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs results in increased expression of the downstream gene. Transcription factor binding is a classic example of how gene expression is regulated, and although there are many components involved in expression, they are a likely candidate for variability [fix this last sentence, not sure what I want to say here] . \\

        \hspace{20pt}Although regulatory mechanisms are conserved, gene expression remains highly variable depending on the context of the cell. Examples of variables associated with differential expression are; temporal cues, tissue-type, and species. Humans and non-human primates (NHP) are highly similar, with humans and chimps differing by only 4\% of the protein-coding regions (Varki & Altheide, 2005). Despite the conservation of coding sequence, many phenotypes are distintive between the two species. For example, the structure of organs such as the salt-wasting kidneys, the immune response, and social organization are variable between humans and NHPs (Varki & Altheide, 2005). Attempts to determine the genetic differences underlying these and other phenotypic changes have revealed that not only are protein-coding sequences highly similar [REFs], but 3’-UTRs also exhibit baseline mutation rates (Li & Su, 2006; H.-Y. Wang et al., 2007). Despite similarities in coding sequence and 3'-UTRs, gene expression levels are significantly different between NHPs and humans (Blekhman, Marioni, Zumbo, Stephens, & Gilad, 2010; Enard et al., 2002; Gilad, Oshlack, Smyth, Speed, & White, 2006), indicating that the regulation of gene expression may play a underlying role in creating larger phenotypic differences. 

An example of gene expression variability between humans and NHPs is exhibited on a tissue-specific level (Blekhman, Oshlack, Chabot, Smyth, & Gilad, 2008). The highly specific structures such as [examples] of the brain have differences in expression between primate species (Khaitovich et al., 2004). Furthermore, [x] and humans differentially express genes located within the chromosome 7 Autism susceptibility locus (Navarro et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2012). 

Since non-coding sequences, such as transcription factor binding sites, are important for coordinating regulation of gene expresion, it is likely that they also play a large role in species-specific differential expression. Indeed, genes that have increased in expression in humans versus non-human primates are enriched for transcription factors, indicating that this level of regulation plays an important role in the differences in gene variation between species\cite{Gilad2006}.

    %Retrotransposons

Recently, Arora et al. have shown that genes differentially expressed between human and chimp are significantly enriched for indels that contain retrotransposons (RT) (Arora, Mittal, Polavarapu, & McDonald, 2011). Retrotransposons (RT) are mobile elements that integrate into the genome via an RNA intermediate [RNA]. There is evidence that the protein machinery responsible for retrotransposition has been present since organism, and may be responsible for proteins viruses etc. RTs exist in almost every organism that has been tested with exceptions in blank and blank, whose genomes are strikingly small in comparison to most eukaryotes. In primates there are three major families of RTs: LINE-1 (L1), Alu, and SVA. In humans, these RTs make up approximately half of the human genome [1]. L1 are Long-autonomous INterspersed Elements (LINE-1, L1) that are capable of initiating their own retrotransposition [REF]. The full-length L1 is approximately 6 kilobases (kb) long and encodes two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) [REF]. ORF1 is necessary for L1 retrotransposition, while ORF2 function alone is capable of mobilizing non-autonomous elements [REF]. ORF2 encodes an endonuclease that cuts ‘AATTTT’ sites at the phosphodiester bond between the adenosine and thymine [REF]. This creates a “TTTT” overhang that RNAs with polyA stretches can bind to. ORF2 also codes for a retrotransposase that then initiates reverse transcription of the RNA from the TTTT/AAAA primed region [REF]. The completed process is termed target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). 
L1 are termed autonomous because they have the ability to initiate their own retrotransposition. Retrotransposition begins from a polyA stretch within the RT that is often found at the 3’ end of the RNA. Since full-length L1 are approximately 6 kb long, TPRT does not always proceed to completion, leaving many truncated L1 in the genome [REF]. 
Non-autonomous elements are mobile elements that do not encode reverse transcriptase or endonucleases, and therefore require the protein products from other RTs in order to mobilize. Two common non-autonomous RTs that have amplified in humans through L1 TPRT are Alu and SVA. Alu elements are approximately 280 base pairs (bp) long, do not encode a protein product, but are capable of promoting their own Polymerase III (Pol-III) transcription. Alu are highly interspersed in the human genome making up ~ x\% of the human genome. SVA elements are approximately 2 kb long, also do not encode a protein product and make up ~ x\% of the human genome. 
Unlike DNA transposons that insert via a cut and paste mechanism, the copy and paste mechanism of RTs results in amplification of the element with each new insertion. The host genome has therefore developed sophisticated responses to minimize the damage and extend of retrotransposition.
