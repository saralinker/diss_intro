        \hspace{20pt}Non-coding mobile genetic elements have the potential to alter the regulation of genes. Gene expression regulation is an evolutionary conserved process that responds to complex cues such as tissue-type, stage of development, and level of cellular stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. As expected, changes in tissue-type, stage of development, and environmental cues require different genes to be expressed to properly manage the organism as a whole. This process of regulating gene expression is multi-facted including contributions from chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, and post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core processes involved in regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA of the following sequence: (5'-[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3'), where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs results in increased expression of the downstream gene. Transcription factor binding is a classic example of how gene expression is regulated, and although there are many components involved in expression, they are a likely candidate for variability [fix this last sentence, not sure what I want to say here] . \\

        \hspace{20pt}Although regulatory mechanisms are conserved, gene expression remains highly variable depending on the context of the cell. Examples of variables associated with differential expression are; temporal cues, tissue-type, and species. Humans and non-human primates (NHP) are highly similar, with humans and chimps differing by only 4\% of the protein-coding regions (Varki & Altheide, 2005). Despite the conservation of coding sequence, many phenotypes are distintive between the two species. For example, the structure of organs such as the salt-wasting kidneys, the immune response, and social organization are variable between humans and NHPs (Varki & Altheide, 2005). Attempts to determine the genetic differences underlying these and other phenotypic changes have revealed that not only are protein-coding sequences highly similar [REFs], but 3â€™-UTRs also exhibit baseline mutation rates (Li & Su, 2006; H.-Y. Wang et al., 2007). Despite similarities in coding sequence and 3'-UTRs, gene expression levels are significantly different between NHPs and humans (Blekhman, Marioni, Zumbo, Stephens, & Gilad, 2010; Enard et al., 2002; Gilad, Oshlack, Smyth, Speed, & White, 2006), indicating that the regulation of gene expression may play a underlying role in creating larger phenotypic differences. 

An example of gene expression variability between humans and NHPs is exhibited on a tissue-specific level (Blekhman, Oshlack, Chabot, Smyth, & Gilad, 2008). The highly specific structures such as [examples] of the brain have differences in expression between primate species (Khaitovich et al., 2004). On chromosome 7 the Autism susceptibility locus as well as other genes associated with communication functions within the brain are differentially expressed between [X] and humans (Navarro et al., 2012; Schneider et al., 2012). 

It is therefore likely that that the intergenic and intronic sequences are largely responsible for species-specific differential expression. Multiple groups have shown that segmental duplications are indeed associated with an increase in expression of the coincident genes (Blekhman, Oshlack, & Gilad, 2009; Hallast, Saarela, Palotie, & Laan, 2008; Khaitovich et al., 2004). These results may be confounded by difficulties in determining differences in expression between homologous genes [REF] when using microarray technologies. More recently, Arora et al. have shown that genes differentially expressed between human and chimp are significantly enriched for RT containing indels (Arora, Mittal, Polavarapu, & McDonald, 2011). Interestingly, Alu, a small interspersed RT, has been hypothesized to be a major contributing factor to the creation of segmental duplications in primates (Bailey, Liu, & Eichler, 2003), as well as a regulator of gene expression [REF].
