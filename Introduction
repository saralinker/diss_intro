%Intro to the intro

Retrotransposons (RTs), a class of mobile DNA elements, are present in almost all major groups of eukaryotes \citep{Arkhipova2000}. They replicate through a prolific "copy and paste" mechanism, facilitating amplification of the element with each new integration. Despite their success at infiltrating many host organisms, RTs have the potential to confer selectable phenotypic changes to an organism, some of which may be deleterious. A primary example is that of RTs disrupting amino acid sequences. For instance when an L1 RT inserted into the last exon of the tumor suppressor gene APC, thereby altering the coding nature of the gene, and triggering sporadic colorectal cancer \citep{Miki1992}.

Future disease studies must be able to predict such disruptions in a manner similar to the now common practice of filtering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In comparison to SNP studies, the analysis of RTs is complicated by the multitude of consequences that insertions can have on a gene.  For example, sequence motifs specific to RTs can induce functional changes by sequestering protein complexes such as chromatin remodellers, enhancers, and polymerases \citep{Humphrey1996,Norris1995,Vansant1995,Chen2009}. Furthermore, the insertions can interrupt coding sequences, disrupt splice signals, and mediate chromosomal rearrangements \citep{Belancio2008a,Belancio2008,Nevers1977}.

An often debated question is whether these attributes of RTs confer a selective advantage or disadvantage to the organism. I hold that these two options are not exclusive of one another. It is likely that the selectable effect of an insertion is dependent upon a dynamic action between factors associated with the RT and factors associated with the insertion location. Indeed studies of the distribution of RTs demonstrate that there is an unequal level of maintenance of RTs depending on location in the genome, indicating that the selection may vary based on genomic context.

Herein is presented a study of RTs and their effects on genes. Evidence is described suggesting that selection shapes the RT distribution within genes in a manner that is dependent on genomic context. Moreover the data presented indicates that RTs effect the selectable phenotype of gene expression in humans.

\section{Retrotransposons}
Mobile elements are composed of two major classes: Type I and Type II transposons. Type I transposons (i.e: Retrotransposons, RTs) integrate into the genome via an RNA intermediate \citep{Slotkin2007}. This is often referred to as a "copy and paste" mechanism due to "copying" of the parent DNA sequence into mRNA that is then inserted into a new location in the genome. The mechanism underlying this form of integration will be described in more detail in section \ref{sec:tprt}. Type II transposons, conversely, insert through a "cut and paste" mechanism, where the parent element is excised from the genome and directly re-inserted into a new location.

Although both RTs and Type II transposons are capable of mobilizing, they have divergent insertion mechanisms as well as varied effects on the host genome. The important distinction of RTs is that with each new insertion, the number of mobile elements in the host genome increases by one, thereby amplifying the number of RT elements present in the genome. Through this amplification, RTs now make up almost 40\% of the current human genome. This is striking considering the 1.5\% of the genome made up of protein-coding sequence (33\% including introns) \citep{Lander2001}.

This large class of RTs can be further subdivided into the subgroups of long-terminal repeat containing RTs (LTR) and non-LTR RTs. LTR-RTs contain long-terminal repeats that flank the internal protein coding sequences. These non-coding repeats facilitate expression as well as integration into the host genome \citep{Havecker2004}. LTR-RTs have a similar structure to retroviruses, containing the \textit{gag} and \textit{pol} genes, though they lack the envelope protein required for ability to exist extracellularly. These elements are present in  primate genomes, however most human LTR-RTs are thought to be inactive remnants of ancient viral insertions. There are a small number of  human-specific LTR-RTs that may still be active in the human genome, though at much lower levels of integration than the non-LTR retrotransposons \citep{Pi2004}. 

Non-LTR-RTs (hereafter referred to as RTs) are the most common form of transposons in the human genome, and will be the focus of the study presented here. Their origins can be traced back to the primitive eukaryote \textit{Giardi lamblia}, predating the origin of viruses and LTR-RTs \citep{Burke2002}. Although their origin can be traced to near the split of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, non-LTR RTs expanded to near present day levels during mammalian evolution \citep{Belancio2008}, and are inherited through mostly vertical transmission \citep{Malik1999}.

There are two major classes of non-LTR RTs, Long INterspersed Elements (LINEs) which are defined as being longer than 500 bp, and Short INterspersed Elements (SINEs) which are smaller. In primates there are two SINEs and one LINE that make up the majority of active elements. These two SINEs are Alu and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA), and the LINE is LINE-1 (L1) (figure \ref{fig:l1}). Alu were originally identified in 1975 through early renaturation techniques that indicated there were numerous 300 bp duplexes apparent in the human genome  \citep{Schmid1975}, a majority of these duplexes were cleaved under \textit{AluI} enzymatic digestion, and were therefore termed Alu elements \citep{Rubin1980}. LINE-1 were originally differentiated from Alu and microsatellites due to their large size ( > 1.2 kilobases (kb)) and digestion by HindIII or KpnI enzymes \citep{Schmeckpeper1981,Manuelidis1982,Shafit-Zagardo1982}. Due to their long length in comparison to Alu and other SINEs they were termed "long" interspersed elements. 

A major distinction of L1 is their ability to encode the proteins required for retrotransposition. Depending on this ability to facilitate their own integration, RTs are termed either "autonomous" or "non-autonomous". The proteins encoded by autonomous RTs must be capable of endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity \citep{Mathias1991,Feng1996}. Without autonomous elements, the non-autonomous elements would be immobile. The non-autonomous elements, therefore, are able to be inserted even though they do not encode the protein machinery themselves.

        \caption[Structure of Human Retrotransposons]{\normalsize{\textbf{Structure of Human Retrotransposons\\} The simplified structures of  LINE-1 (L1), Alu, and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) are shown here. \textbf{L1} is broken up into three main regions: 5\rq - UTR, the protein coding region, and the 3\rq - region and is approximately 6kb long. The 5\rq -UTR regions contains a Pol-II promoter sequence with bidirectional activity (green arrows). This region also contains homology to the Alu sequence. Sense transcription of L1 copies the bicistronic mRNA encoding two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2; red boxes). There is also a 3\rq region of the L1 transcript that contains a 3\rq -UTR (dark green)  and an active polyadenylation sequence as well as a polyA tail (light green).\textbf{Alu} is transcribed by the Pol-III via internal A and B box sequences (red boxes) and is approximately 280 - 300 bp long. The center region of Alu is rich in adenosines and often is of the sequence A$_{6}$TACA$_{6}$ . The 3\rq region of the Alu also contains a polyA tail (light green). \textbf{SVA} is a composite elements that is roughly 2kb long. The 5\rq portion of SVA contains a CCCTCT$_{n}$ repeat sequence. This is linked to an Alu-like sequence, followed by a region containing a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR). This is then linked to a SINE-like sequence, and finally there is a polyA sequence at the 3\rq end.}}
        \label{fig:l1}
    \end{figure}

In the current mammalian genome, L1 is the most prevalent and active autonomous element  \citep{Feng1996,Mathias1991}. The full-length L1 is approximately 6kb in humans and ~7.5kb in mouse (figure ~\ref{fig:l1})  \citep{Belancio2008}. The mRNA is bicistronic, encoding two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) promoted via an internal Polymerase-II (Pol-II) promoter \citep{Minakami1992,Swergold1990}. Transcription of L1 is initiated at the first bp, thereby enabling the promoter to be mobilized upon integration of the full RT, and allowing maintenance of  transcriptional activity upon re-integration \citep{Minakami1992}. This Pol-II promoter is bidirectional and therefore has the ability to enhance transcription both of the L1 sequence, and of sequence upstream of the L1 promoter \citep{Matlik2006}. Though the upstream sequence can be transcribed by the antisense promoter, and potentially act as a non-coding RNA \citep{Cruickshanks2013}, it would not likely be retrotransposed since it would not contain the hallmark sequences required for retrotransposition.

The ORFs encoded by L1 have very different roles in retrotransposition. ORF1 protein (ORF1p) has nucleic acid binding and chaperone activity, and is essential for  L1, but not Alu, retrotransposition.  The exact role of ORF1p is currently unknown, however mutations in conserved arginine residues abolish L1 retrotransposition. These same mutations reduce ORF1p\rq s affinity for single-strand RNA, as well as DNA melting and strand-exchange ability \citep{Martin2005}. Structurally, ORF1p associates via a coiled-coil domain with itself to create a trimer that then binds to the L1 RNA \citep{Martin2003}. ORF1p also associates with ORF2p in the ribonucleoprotein particle that is required for functional retrotransposition, and mutations in ORFp1 disrupt the formation of this particle \citep{Doucet2010}.

The ORF2 product of L1 (ORF2p) does most of the work in retrotransposition, encoding an endonuclease near the N-terminus, a reverse transcriptase, and a zinc-finger domain at the C-terminus \citep{Moran1996,Ostertag2001}. The ORF2p reverse transcriptase is highly processive, able to copy cDNA at least five times longer than the Moloney murine leukemia viral reverse transcriptase. It has slower processivity, however, through runs of polyG\rq s that coincide with hairpin-loop structures \citep{Piskareva2006}. The endonuclease encoded by ORF2 is in the internal portion of the protein. The binding specificity of this endonuclease is for 5\rq -TTAAAA motifs in the target DNA \citep{Cost1998,Szak2002}, though there are other factors that modify the selection of integration sites. For example, DNA that is in the chromatin state is less likely to be nicked by the L1 endonuclease than naked DNA \citep{Cost2001}. There are some DNA sequences, however, where nicking is enhanced in the presence of chromatin \citep{Cost2001}. This finding was not surprising since the L1 endonuclease shows specificity for super-coiled DNA \citep{Feng1996}. The final, 3\rq , portion of ORF2p is the cytosine-rich, zinc-finger-like C-terminus. Mutations in this zinc-finger domain significantly reduces retrotransposition \citep{Moran1996}. It is hypothesized that this region facilitates the autonomous nature of L1 through non-specific binding to non-autonomous RNA \citep{Piskareva2013}.  

The non-autonomous Alu and SVA SINEs have successfully hijacked the retrotransposition capabilities of L1 to amplify in primate genomes. Similar SINEs exist in many species with some of the oldest members present since before the split of mammals and birds $\sim$ 350 million years ago (mya) \citep{Nishihara2006}. The majority originated from 5S-RNA or tRNAs, however Alu, a primate specific RT, originated from the 7SL-RNA (7SL) (figure\ref{fig:alu_line}). 7SL is an integral component of the signal recognition particle, and is responsible for trafficking secretory proteins through the ER \citep{Gundelfinger1984}. It is thought that an ancient 7SL duplicated into a pseudogene called the fossil Alu monomer (FAM) \citep{Quentin1992}. FAM then underwent mutations, and subsequently amplified as two separate monomeric repeats \citep{Quentin1992}. Since these repeats would become the left and right components of Alu, they were appropriately named Fossil Left Alu Monomer (FLAM) and Fossil Right Alu Monomer (FRAM). Eventually FLAM and FRAM were joined into a dimer by a central A-rich region which is the common ancestor of the modern Alu \citep{Quentin1992a}.

The present day Alu has succeeded in leveraging the retrotransposition protein machinery of L1 to expand to millions of copies in the human genome \citep{Lander2001}. One hypothesis for the success of Alu as a non-autonomous retrotransposon is the secondary structure imparted by the 7SL ancestor sequence. 7SL has high affinity for the SRP 9/14 proteins from the signal recognition particle. Dewannieux et al. hypothesized that the similar binding of Alu to SRP 9/14 facilitates shuttling Alu to the ER where the L1 ribonucleoprotein particles reside, thereby enhancing the mobility of Alu \citep{Hsu1995, Dewannieux2003}. They also posit that SRP 9/14 may perform some of the roles that ORF1p plays in L1 retrotransposition. The recent finding that SRP 14 was one of the factors associated with L1-ORF1p in a yeast two-hybrid screen \citep{Goodier2013}, indicates that the SRP proteins may in fact be involved in facilitating retrotransposition.

Alu then subsequently amplified as well as mutated, thus giving rise to the subfamilies in modern primates (AluJ, AluS, and AluY).

SVA, another primate-specific non-autonomous RT, is partially composed of Alu sequence. It is a composite element that contains regions with similarity to Alu and the human endogenous retrovirus (hERV), as well as a variable number tandem repeat region \citep{Hancks2010}. SVA are still active in the human genome, though at lower levels than either L1 or Alu \citep{Stewart2011}. Even younger than the primate-specific Alu, SVA appear to have evolved relatively recently. They are found only in primates and most commonly in humans, chimpanzee, and gorilla \citep{Zhu1994}. SVA contain all of the necessary requirements for non-autonomous retrotransposition, mainly an internal promoter, and a long polyadenylation stretch at the 3\rq -end (discussed in section \ref{sec:tprt}).

%Subfamilies of Retrotransposons
\section{Subfamilies of Retrotransposons}

Each RT family (L1, Alu, and SVA), can be divided into subfamilies based on similar, diagnostic, mutations in their sequence. The underlying assumption of grouping subfamilies by diagnostic mutations, is that RTs with similar mutations (i.e: same subfamily) are likely to have mobilized around the same time in evolutionary history. This is a logical assumption since RTs are vertically transmitted, and successive similar mutations in divergent subfamilies of RTs is unlikely. There are highly active elements ("hot") that are responsible for most of the mobilization within subgroups \citep{Cordaux2009}. These "hot" master elements may mobilize other active elements as well, which then produce more insertions, but they account for most of the mobilization. Therefore, the model of RT subfamilies is that a small number of  parent elements are responsible for the retrotransposition of many elements within a discrete period of evolutionary time \citep{Cordaux2009}. These parent elements gain mutations and are eventually rendered immobile. These accumulated mutations are therefore useful in determining the time-scale in which a RT element was amplified.  

It is estimated that there are 80 - 100 master L1 elements actively mobile in humans, though this is likely to be an underestimate \citep{Brouha2003}. The subfamilies of L1 have been evolving for approximately 170 million years, since before the marsupial eutherian split \citep{Smit1996}, and in a direct lineage for over 40 million years \citep{Khan2006}. The most active L1 were present in the early primate genome and amplified between 40 and 12 mya \citep{Khan2006}. In humans, there are over 100 L1 subfamilies identified \citep{Smit1995,SmitAfaHubleyRandGreen}, with the major groups denoted as L1M, L1P, and L1Hs. These subfamilies were distinguished based on differences in the 3\rq -ends of the ORF2 sequence, therefore each subfamily is associated with a unique consensus sequence. Only a small portion of these mobilization competent L1 are thought to be "hot" elements \citep{Brouha2003,Lutz2003}. The "hot" L1 elements in the human genome are a part of the human-specific subfamily, L1-Ta \citep{Brouha2003}. Furthermore, L1-Ta is the only presently active subfamily in humans, and has a germline insertion rate of 1 in 270 births \citep{Ewing2011}. 

The burst of Alu mobilization also occurred around 35 - 60 mya \citep{Shen1991}. Despite the recent formation of Alu, there are over 30 subfamilies with three major families, from oldest to youngest being: AluJ, AluS, and AluY.  Although evidence from population studies suggests that the only active subfamilies of Alu are within the AluY lineage \citep{Stewart2011}, there is contested evidence to suggest that AluS may retain some ability for mobilization \citep{Bennett2008}. There are an estimated 143 master AluY presently active in the human genome \citep{Bennett2008}. Whereas for L1 all master elements came from the L1-Ta, there are multiple actively mobile subfamilies of AluY (e.g: AluYa5 and AluYb8). Together they have an combined insertion rate of 1 in 20 births \citep{Cordaux2006}. 

SVA are the youngest of the three elements, originating around 25 mya \citep{Wang2005a}. Due to their high homology to one another there are only six subfamilies of SVA. SVA, as a group, are largely promoted by external gene promoters located upstream of the SVA sequence \citep{Damert2009}. This process is termed 5\rq -transduction. The transduction of these promoters can result in the mobilization of non-SVA DNA to new genomic locations, a concept that will be revisited in section \ref{sec:rear}.
    
%Process of Retrotransposition
\section{Process of Retrotransposition}
\label{sec:tprt}

L1, Alu, and SVA are mobilized through the process of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) \citep{Raiz2011,Dewannieux2003,Ostertag2001}. TPRT is a "copy and paste" method of transposition, necessitating the involvement of an RNA-intermediate. In humans the enzymes that carry out TPRT are encoded by L1. The process begins by the transcription of the ORF1 and ORF2 components of full-length L1. ORF2p is required for integration of L1, however it is not necessary, but enhances, the integration of Alu \citep{Wallace2008}. It has been hypothesized that RNA transcribed by Pol-III is integrated more quickly than Pol-II \citep{Kroutter2009}, offering a rationale for the abundance of Alu integrations. Indeed Alu, which are transcribed by Pol-III, integrate at higher rates than that of L1, which is transcribed by Pol-II. Upon transcription of the RT, the RNA is shuttled out of the nucleus where it forms an ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) with the L1 ORF1p and ORF2p \citep{Doucet2010,Hohjoh1996,Kulpa2005}. A number of host factors are also be present in this RNP that contribute to mobilization. For example, PABPC1, MOV10, UPF1, and PCNA have all been identified to associate within L1 RNPs \citep{Taylor2013}. A subset of these proteins repress retrotransposition, such as MOV10 \citep{Arjan-Odedra2012}, while some of them enhance it. For example, PABPC1 enhances retrotransposition through binding the polyadenosine (polyA) tail of mRNAs \citep{DelCampo2009}. The knockdown of polyA binding proteins such as PABPC1 has been shown to reduce retrotransposition while retaining the transcription and translation capacity of L1 \citep{Dai2012}. Interestingly, it has also been shown that retrotransposons with longer A-tails are more efficient at retrotransposition \citep{Comeaux2009}. These results all indicate that the polyA tail present in L1, Alu, and SVA is an intrinsic modifier of the efficacy of retrotransposition.

Upon formation of the RNP, the complex is reintroduced into the nucleus. The process of insertion begins by the ORF2p cleaving a single stranded nick at the A-T phosphodiester bond in an 5\rq -TTAAAA  motif \citep{Feng1996}. Although there are known hotspots of integration \citep{Wimmer2011}, it is still hypothesized that the selection of the 5\rq -TTAAA motif is random \citep{Ovchinnikov2001}. After the first strand is nicked, the stretch of adenosine nucleotides at the end of the mobilized RNA hybridizes to the \lq TTTT\rq s of the nicked DNA. Reverse transcription begins from this primed region, copying the retrotransposon RNA into cDNA from the 3\rq-OH end of the \lq TTTT\rq . The reverse transcription proceeds from this point.

Since Alu are short, \textasciitilde{}300bp elements, they are normally completely reverse transcribed. Full-length L1 however, are  \textasciitilde{}6kb in length, and the retrotransposition process does not always proceed until completion. The incomplete processing of L1 retrotransposons is termed 5\rq - truncation and many of L1 in the human genome exist in this form at approximately 1kb in length. The conclusion of TPRT results in a duplication of the flanking DNA sequence, termed target-site duplications \citep{Kojima2010}. These regions are often used to validate whether an insertion is real, or whether it is false positive. In rare events, the process of TPRT is accompanied by structural rearrangements in the region. The link between retrotransposition and structural rearrangements will be discussed more in section \ref{sec:rear}.

%Selection on the sex chromosomes versus the autosomes

\section{Selection on the Sex Chromosomes}
\label{sec:selection}
Since this study will be, in part, examining forces of selection on RTs, it is important to note the differences in selection on the autosomes and the sex chromosomes. These differences will be used to develop hypotheses of the expected distributions of RTs on different chromosomes in the presence of selective forces.

The effective population size is a key determinant of the ability for selection to act in the context of genetic drift \citep{Charlesworth2009}. The autosomes and the sex chromosomes have different effect population sizes. This is partially due to the limited number of X and Y chromosomes in comparison to autosomes. 

    %%Effective population size : Autosome
    %\begin{equation}
    %    N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{4N_{\textit{m}}N_{\textit{f}}}{N_{\textit{m}} + N_{\textit{f}}}
    %    \label{eq:auto}
    %\end{equation}
    %
    %%Effective population size : ChrX
    %\begin{equation}
    %    N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{9N_{\textit{m}}N_{\textit{f}}}{4N_{\textit{m}} + 2N_{\textit{f}}}
    %    \label{eq:chrx}
    %\end{equation}
    %
    %%Effective population size : ChrY
    %\begin{equation}
    %    N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{N_{\textit{m}}}{2}
    %     \label{eq:chry}
    %\end{equation}

Another factor at play in the difference of selection between chrX and chrY is the effect termed "Muller\rq s ratchet" \citep{Muller1964}. Muller posited that recombination is highly important for purifying selection. This theory states that there is a lack of an ability to purify deleterious mutations from the chromosome due to reduced recombination. Each generation cannot "recombine out" deleterious mutations, and therefore has a higher genetic load of deleterious mutations to begin with. In the concept of Muller\rq s ratchet, this mutational load is ever increasing. Effects such as Muller's ratchet that reduce the effective population size are hypothesized to have resulted in the degeneration of genes on chrY \citep{Charlesworth2000}. Although studies have shown that deleterious mutations are accumulating on chrY, purifying selection is still possible \citep{WilsonSayres2014}.

The advantage of studying selection on the sex chromosomes versus the autosomes is that each of these chromosome groups undergo varying selective forces. One example is that autosomes, chrX, and chrY have different effective population sizes, where the effective population size of autosomes is greater than that of chrX which is greater than chrY. Importantly, however, in the case of recessive mutations, chrX can eliminate these mutations easier since it spends half of its time in the hemizygous state. Using this prior knowledge assumptions can be made regarding the expected relative frequencies of mutations between the chromosomes.

%Distribution of Retrotransposons 
%    \textnormal\Large\textit{\\\\\num{1.6 } Natural Selection and the Distribution of Retrotransposons in Genes\\}
\section{Selection and the Distribution of Retrotransposons}
\label{sec:dist}

    The distribution of RTs in the current human genome can be an indication of forces of selection or the effect that the RT is having on the organism. Evidence that selection is acting on RTs comes from the random distribution of young elements that becomes non-randomly distributed over long spans of evolutionary time. Although this pattern could be explained in part by other forces such as genetic drift, imbalanced segregating allele frequencies indicate that selective forces are playing a role in this distribution \citep{Stewart2011}. RTs insert in the human genome at a rate of approximately 1 in 20 births for Alu, 1 in 270 births for L1, and 1 in 916 births for SVA \citep{Cordaux2006,Ewing2010,Xing2009}. Although the distribution immediately after insertion is unknown, polymorphic insertions are evenly distributed throughout the genome \citep{Stewart2011}, as are young L1 present in the reference genome \citep{Ovchinnikov2001}. 

\subsubsection{Distribution of RTs: Change over Evolutionary Time}
Some localized hotspots of insertion have been noted, however. For example, the combination of host DNA sequence and nucleosome occupancy are modifiers of the frequency of retrotransposition \citep{Cost2001}. NF1 is a hotspot for both Alu and L1 integration events \citep{Wimmer2011}. Furthermore, young RTs are often nested within older elements, which some studies have taken as indication of RTs creating hotspots for the integration of new RTs \citep{Levy2010}. Despite these limited findings of insertion hotspots, it is still accepted that RTs insert relatively randomly throughout the genome.
    
Contrary to the young elements, RTs with long residence times in a population show a non-random distribution across the genome. Aberrations in the otherwise random distribution of older elements can be taken as a signs of local selection or genetic drift.

Interestingly, Alu and L1 do not show the same trends of altered densities. Alu tend to be present in higher numbers in in GC-rich regions and to cluster with one another, whereas L1 are increased in AT-rich regions \citep{Pavlicek2001,Soriano1983}. These altered distributions of Alu and L1 indicate that there may be differential selective pressures acting on RTs. It is therefore important to determine if there are selective pressures acting on RTs depending on the genomic context of integration. The presence of variable selective pressures would indicate that a) RTs exert a non-neutral effect on the genome, b) different regions of the genome may be more sensitive to RT insertions, and c) that polymorphic RTs may impart phenotypic variability to an organism. If polymorphic RTs impart phenotypic variability, then these elements have the potential to account for some of the missing phenotypic heritability observed in GWAS \citep{Marian2012}. 

\subsubsection{Distribution of RTs: Structural Rearrangements}
One example of a genomic force leading to the altered distribution of Alu, is the process of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Homologous recombination is a process of double-strand break repair that uses the availability of sister chromatids to repair the break. NAHR is similar in procedure to HR, however it uses two sequences that are similar, but not sister chromatids, to repair the broken region. NAHR therefore often results in deletions, or rearrangements. Since Alu are highly interspersed and have strong homology to one another they are common substrates of NAHR \citep{Sen2006, Witherspoon2009}. It is has even been shown that this increased propensity for NAHR has resulted in Alu being responsible for a majority of the segmental duplications currently present in the human genome. Alu mediated NAHR is also responsible for many of the rearrangements present between human and non-human primates \citep{Bailey2003}. When Alu are used as substrates for NAHR, the result would be two Alu residing close to one another, rather than at farther, more random distances, and thus has been used as a hypothesis to describe the co-clustering of Alu in GC-rich regions \citep{Jurka2004}. Furthermore, the ubiquitous removal of newly inserted Alu, would reduce the load in AT-rich regions \citep{Jurka2004}.

\subsubsection{Distribution of RTs: Purifying versus Positive Selection}
Despite large scale rearrangements of RT densities, there is evidence of selection at the level of the individual element. One study, indicating that RTs undergo purifying selection, examined the rate of heterozygosity of polymorphic RTs in various human populations. They found that Alu and L1 are present more often in the heterozygous state than expected \citep{Stewart2011}. 

Although many groups suggest that RTs are undergoing purifying selection \citep{Jurka2004, Stewart2011}, there are also studies suggesting the potential of positive selection acting on RTs. The altered distribution of Alu in the draft reference genome with respect to GC-content initially caused speculation that RTs were under the influence of positive selection \citep{Lander2001}. A similar GC-bias is observed in B1 within mice. B1 are rodent-specific SINEs that are similar to Alu, but that are not derived from Alu. This finding of seemingly convergent evolutionary forces led the authors to claim that the distribution of Alu and B1 are present due to forces of positive selection \citep{Tsirigos2009}, though there is not much data to support the hypothesis of positive selection versus purifying selection in this case. The population genetics community responded to the claim of positive selection in the Lander et al. paper with skepticism. Brookfield cited less complicated mechanisms as potential mediators of the altered RT distribution, such as recombination of Alu elements, hitchhiker effects, and the change in GC-content over time \citep{Hellen2013}.

One piece of evidence supporting positive selection is that specific bases within the Alu consensus sequences are mutated less often than expected at random \citep{Britten1994}. Some of these mutations, however, are necessary for Alu transcription and are therefore more likely to be maintained across subfamilies \citep{Brookfield1994}. For example, a large number of the mutations that were found were located within the Polymerase-III binding regions \citep{Britten1994}. These nucleotides would be required for retrotransposition and are therefore more likely to be present than other nucleotides. Since this original paper was published in 1994, almost a decade ahead of the draft genome sequence, it is possible that there are other nucleotides within Alu and other retrotransposon sequences are maintained that could not have been picked up with the small sample size they were working with (1500 elements) \citep{Britten1994}. It is important to revisit this question with the data currently available that would facilitate analysis of the conservation of each nucleotide.

%[OTHER POSITIVE SELECTION]
        
%Understanding the factors associated with these observed distribution biases could help to predict the functional impact RT insertions. Furthermore, Studying the non-random distribution of RTs within genes will provide further evidence of the selectable interaction between RT and genomic context.

%Retrotransposons are more common near transcription start sites [write more from this paper!] \citep{Tsirigos2009}.
\subsubsection{Distribution of RTs: High Copy Number}
Previous studies have taken advantage of the high copy number of RTs to study the relationships of mobile elements with the host genome, revealing the capacity of various genomic contexts to withstand retrotransposition. There are 1.1e06, 9.5e05, and 3.7e03 Alu, L1, and SVA respectively annotated in the human Hg19 reference genome \citep{Kent2002}. Furthermore, the 1000 genomes project has identified thousands of Alu, L1, and SVA respectively that are segregating within humans. These segregating, or polymorphic RTs allow us to study the effects of polymorphic elements on the genome, as well as to look at distributions of early integration. 

    %Antisense Bias 
\section{Antisense Bias of Retrotransposons in Genes}
%stopped here -->
The non-random distribution of RTs is likely a result of a combination of variables such as the selection coefficient of the mutation, the effective population size, and the rate of recombination in the region of the mutation. Interestingly, the distributions of RTs in genes differs depending on orientation of the RT with respect to the gene. Elements in the antisense orientation (AS) with respect to a gene are more common than elements that are oriented in the sense (S) direction, termed antisense bias (AS bias) \citep{VanDeLagemaat2006}. When in the same region, RTs in either orientation would be expected to be undergoing similar levels of genetic drift, effects of population size, and hitchhiker effects.  The varying distribution is likely the result of either selection on the RT based on the orientation, or a bias due to TPRT. Antisense bias is observed in Alu, L1, and even the non-LTR human endogenous retrovirus. It is still unknown whether AS bias is due to the process of integration, or is due to a mechanism of selection over time. One of the focuses of the research presented here is to determine whether integration or selection is the driving force of AS bias of RTs.

    %The Dynamics of Regulating Gene Expression 
\section{The Dynamics of Regulating Gene Expression}
The genome responds to spatio-temporal and environmental cues by regulating gene expression \citep{Coulon2013,Spitz2012}, thereby coordinating tissue-type, stage of development, as well as responses to external stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. Regulating gene expression is a multi-facted process including chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, and post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core components of regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and enhancers, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA with the sequence: 5\rq -[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3\rq where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs can result in increased expression of the downstream gene. Other similar proteins may induce decreased expression, alternative splicing, or coordinated regulation with other genes.

Aberrant regulation of gene expression is often associated with disease, and therefore many studies focus on the genetic determinants of altered gene expression. Variations associated with differential expression are termed expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Although these variants may occur within the coding region \citep{Delker2011}, they more commonly occur near transcription start sites and within  regulatory regions \citep{Veyrieras2008}. Despite there being many other forms of genetic variation, these eQTL studies generally examine small nucleotide variants, such as SNPs and small indels. Larger variations are often missed such as large structural rearrangements, copy number variations, and mobile element insertions. Importantly, it is these larger variations that track most with large scale changes in phenotype, such as the loss of conserved non-protein coding elements through deletions \citep{Hiller2012}. Moreover, chromosomes that have undergone large scale rearrangements have a 2 fold faster protein evolution rate between humans and chimps \citep{Navarro2003}

%Differential Gene Expression Between Humans and Non-human Primates
\section{Variation in Gene Expression Between Humans and Non-human Primates}

The coding genome of humans and non-human primates (NHP) are highly similar, with humans and chimps differing by only 4\% of the protein-coding regions  \citep{Varki2005}. Despite the conservation of coding sequence, many phenotypes are distinctive between the two species. For example, the structure of organs such as the salt-wasting kidneys, the immune response, and social organization are variable between humans and NHPs \citep{Varki2005}. Attempts to determine the genetic differences underlying these and other phenotypic changes have revealed that not only are protein-coding sequences highly similar, but 3\rq -UTRs also exhibit baseline mutation rates  \citep{Li2006, Wang2007}. Gene expression levels, however, are significantly different between NHPs and humans  \citep{Blekhman2008, Gilad2006}, indicating that the regulation of gene expression may play a underlying role in the development of larger phenotypic differences. 

%An example of gene expression variability between humans and NHPs is exhibited on a tissue-specific level \citep{Blekhman2008}. The highly specific structures such as [EXAMPLES!!!!!!] of the brain have differences in expression between primate species \citep{Khaitovich2004}. Furthermore, [XXXXXX!!!!] and humans differentially express genes located within the chromosome 7 Autism susceptibility locus  \citep{Navarro2012, Schneider2012}. 

Since non-coding sequences, such as transcription factor binding sites, are important for coordinating regulation of gene expression, it is likely that they also play a large role in species-specific differential expression. Indeed, genes with increased in expression in humans versus non-human primates are enriched for transcription factors, indicating that changes in transcriptional regulation may play an important role in the differences in gene variation between species \citep{Gilad2006}.

%Retrotransposons as sources of non-coding regulation
\section{Retrotransposons as Non-coding Sources of Regulating Gene Expression}

 Retrotransposons have shaped the regulatory code of the human genome throughout primate evolution. They contribute to splice sites \citep{Sorek2002,Belancio2008,Krull2005,Lev-Maor2008}, A-to-I RNA editing \citep{Athanasiadis2004}, nucleosome binding signals \citep{Englander1993,Englander1995,Tanaka2010}, histone modification signals \citep{Huda2010}, DNA cytosine methylation \citep{Liu1993,Schmid1991}, transcription factor binding sites \citep{Yang1996,Vansant1995,Pandey2011}, and primate-specific enhancers \citep{Jacques2013}. The attribute of RTs that makes them capable of having these effects is that RTs contain sequence motifs that can act as binding sites for transcription factors \citep{Polak2006}, polymerases \citep{Fuhrman1981,Minakami1992,Swergold1990}, polyadenylation enzymes \citep{Kaer2011}, and other regulatory proteins. Therefore, when RTs integrate into a new location they may impact regulatory mechanisms as well as the protein coding regions of the gene. 
 
One way that RT insertions effect transcription is through altering splice sites. Alu, L1, and SVA all contain potential splice donor and acceptor sites, and upon inserting into gene boundaries these signals can effect the structure of the final mRNA. SVA is efficient at co-opting splicing enzymes  often resulting in 5\rq transduction of non-repetitive sequence during SVA mobilization \citep{Damert2009}. SVA can also effect splicing of the endogenous transcript. For example, an insertion of SVA into the 3\rq -UTR of the fukutin gene resulted in aberrant splicing and the development of Fukuyama muscular dystrophy in Japanese individuals \citep{Taniguchi-Ikeda2011}. Alu and L1 also often provide splice signals, and are responsible for a large proportion of alternative isoforms in humans \citep{Lev-Maor2008}. 

Alternative splicing due to RTs can result in the  inclusion of a RT into the final mRNA, termed exonization. Since Alu have expanded to millions of copies in the human genome, it is possible that the genome has developed a response to limit the number of Alu exonization events \citep{Zarnack2013}. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C) is a RNA-binding protein that competes with splicing factors to inhibit this inclusion of Alu into the final mRNA. Another link between Alu and alternative splicing is through the propensity of Alu to undergo Adenosine to Inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing. Alu are common targets of A-to-I editing in the genome because they often reside as inverted repeats in close proximity to one another \citep{Athanasiadis2004}. The secondary structure created by the binding of these elements is highly prone to editing by the enzyme ADAR1 \citep{Iizasa2009}. Due to fluctuations in the secondary structure, the number and placement of sites edited within an mRNA is variable, depending on the length and secondary structure of the molecule \citep{Rieder2013,Blow2006}. The effects of these editing events are still under study, however it is known that when Alu are highly edited, the Alu alters exon choice leading to alternative splicing \citep{Athanasiadis2004,Lev-Maor2008}.

%Structural Rearrangments associated with retrotransposition
\section{Structural Rearrangements Associated with Retrotransposition}
\label{sec:rear}
Other than the direct amplification of the RT, there are other structural effects, such as deletions, rearrangements, and transduction events that are associated with the process of retrotransposition. Deletions are a often result of the process of transposon insertion evidenced from non-LTR RTs in humans, HO cleavage of the mating type locus in \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae} \citep{Moore1996}, as well as IS1-mediated deletions in \textit{Escherichia coli} \citep{Nevers1977}. Non-LTR RT-mediated deletions in primates are responsible for an estimated 7.5 megabases (Mb) of sequence lost. Furthermore, there is an estimated 18 kilobases (kb) between human and chimp due to L1 integration, and 9kb due to Alu alone \citep{Han2005,Callinan2005}. Large (2 -14 kb) deletions are common in cell culture \citep{Gilbert2005,Gilbert2002,Symer2002}, and range from local to intrachromosomal deletions \citep{Gilbert2005}. Studies comparing primate genomes, however, reveal most deletions are very small ( < 100 bp) and follow a Poisson distribution with a maximum size of ~5kb \citep{Han2005}. It is possible that the discrepancy between the size range of deletions in cell culture and primate comparison studies is due to purifying selection of large deletion events. Two mechanisms proposed for RT-mediated deletions are NAHR and L1-endonuclease independent retrotransposition (figure \ref{fig:dsbr} \citep{Callinan2005}). Alu are particularly good substrates for NAHR because they are highly interspersed in the genome, and have a high GC content, which can stabilize the repair structure. L1-endonuclease independent retrotransposition is the process by where the initial double strand break is created by a means other than the L1 endonuclease. This break is then "filled in" using available template from the RT RNA and the L1 reverse transcriptase. There is evidence that this form of RT plays a role in stabilizing telomeres \citep{Morrish2007}. These deletions create variability in the human population, but may also be a process associated with disease such as cancer and this connection will be elaborated on more in section \ref{sec:pheno}\citep{Raschke2005, Florl2003}.

The RT then binds to the regions of homology and is used as a template for reverse transcription (red line), thereby healing the DSB at the cost of a small deletion.}}
        \label{fig:dsbr}
    \end{figure}


Genomic duplications are another by-product of RT-mediated NAHR, with Alu thought to be responsible for a large proportion of the highly-homologous segmental duplications in humans \citep{Bailey2003}. Most of these duplications are larger than the observed deletions, averaging ~1 Mb \citep{Bailey2003}. The majority were facilitated through the younger AluY and AluS subfamilies, and most commonly from AluS. This indicates that large scale genomic duplication events in the time range of AluS, after the divergence of new and old world monkeys, are due to Alu-Alu recombinations. 

The process of post-intertional transposon-mediated recombination has observed across many species including human, mouse, \textit{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}, and of course the famous \textit{Zea Mays} \citep{Mieczkowski2006,Edelmann1989, Hu1998}. A 120kb inversion on chr12 was identified using an L1 integration cassette, and is thought to have occurred as a result of the integration process \citep{Symer2002}. RT-mediated structural rearrangements are commonly thought to be a result of post-insertion processes, similar to those resulting in deletions and duplications. There are at least 252 RT-mediated inversions between humans and chimps that have altered the structure, while maintaining the mass, of the genome \citep{Lee2008}. Three of these loci include exons, indicating a potential for altering phenotypes between species \citep{Lee2008}. 

Another mechanism of structural change due to RT mobilization is the transduction of non-repeat sequence. Sequence transduction occurs either to the 5\rq  or 3\rq  side of the RT, and has been observed both through \textit{in silico} analysis as well as \textit{in vitro} \citep{Symer2002,Damert2009,Pickeral2000}. 5\rq transduction occurs when the retrotransposon is promoted by an upstream gene promoter. This is often the case in SVA mobilization \citep{Damert2009}, where approximately 8\% of all SVA elements have identified 5\rq - sequence transductions. One ancient transduction event in particular, of the MAST2 promoter, has enhanced the transcription activity and facilitated the insertion of an entire group of SVA elements \citep{Damert2009}. 3\rq  transduction is more common than 5\rq - and occurs with both SVA and L1 retrotransposition \citep{Damert2009,Pickeral2000}. In this case, the polymerase continues to transcribe beyond the RT polyadenylation signal and into non-repeat sequence. On average the length of the transduced sequence ranges from 200 - 300 bp \citep{Goodier2000,Pickeral2000}.If this sequence has homology to the sequence at the insertion point, it can then be inserted upon reintegration. The 3\rq region is not always mobilized with the element, even if it is transcribed. For example, Alu have weak Pol-III termination sequences and therefore often terminate at a region downstream of the RT sequence. This downstream unique sequence is not reintegrated, since priming on the polyT sequence is facilitated through the polyA tail within the Alu. Despite the requirement for homology for reincorporation, approximately 15\% of L1 show evidence of 3\rq - transduction events. It has been proposed that the mechanisms of 5\rq - and 3\rq - transduction are capable of "shuffling" exons in the human genome, thereby adding variation. An extension to this is the \textit{trans} mobilization of retropseudogenes and non-processed RNA from the L1 reverse transcriptase but without the coincident transcription of the RT \citep{Ejima2003,Esnault2000,Dewannieux2005}. 


\section{Phenotypic Effects of Retrotransposons}
\label{sec:pheno}

RTs can lead to both disease-causing and advantageous phenotypic changes. RT insertions into coding exon sequences are often associated with diseases such as the insertion of Alu into factor IX leading to hemophilia \citep{Vidaud1993}, BRCA2 in breast cancer \citep{Miki1996,Teugels2005}, and NF1 leading to neurofibromatosis \citep{Wallace1991}. Similarly L1 insertions can also disrupt coding sequence by inserting into exons \citep{Kazazian1988,Li2001,Mukherjee2004}. Interestingly RT insertions into the introns can also lead to disease mainly through the creation of cryptic splice sites. Such was the case with the insertion of Alu into the intron of ALPS which resulted in skipping of exon 8 and led to autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome \citep{Tighe2002}. Alternatively, the insertion of L1 into the intron created a cryptic splice site that included the L1 in the mature mRNA \citep{VandenHurk2003}.

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:rear}, RTs are prolific templates for recombination, especially Alu which is associated with at least 50 human diseases through Alu-Alu recombination \citep{Callinan2005}. For example, familial instances of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy \citep{Hu1991}, Fabry-disease \citep{Kornreich1990}, Tay Sachs \citep{Myerowitz1987}, Lesch-Nyhan disease \citep{Brooks2001}, and many others have been associated with Alu recombination events. Furthermore, there have been many independent discoveries of Alu-mediated recombination in the low-density liporeceptor gene associated with hypercholesterolemia \citep{Chae1997,Lehrman1987,Lehrman1985,Rudiger1991,Yamakawa1989, Goldmann2010}. L1 recombination events have also been associated with diseases such as Alport syndrome-diffuse leiomyomatosis \citep{Segal1999}, though the discovery of disease causing L1-recombination events is less common than that of Alu. Interestingly there are also reports of diseases due to deletions from Alu-L1 recombination events, such as maple-syrup urine disease \citep{Silao2004} and Duchenne muscular dystrophy \citep{Suminaga2000}, indicating the promiscuity of sequence allowed for recombination.

There are many other cases and mechanisms of RTs leading to disease, such as through the deletions associated with insertions as well as 3\rq  transduction events. Although these mechanisms are well described and published in plenty, there may be a skew in the literature in association with disease-causing insertions, due to ascertainment bias. As increasing numbers of "unaffected" individuals are sequenced the RT component underlying normal variation should begin to be revealed, though there are cases available to date. For example, the case of Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene that is under tight control during development. WT1 contains a full length Alu in the promoter region. When the Alu is deleted, the promoter loses the ability to appropriately silence the WT1 gene in HeLa cells \citep{Hewitt1995}.

Another case was within a primate conserved Alu/L1 composite sequence within the SLC7A2 gene. A mutation in this sequence resulted in infantile encephalopathy, indicating that the RT sequence had been co-opted by the host for a conserved phenotypic function. Upon further analysis it was revealed that this portion of the SLC7A2 gene was transcribed as a ncRNA in the brain, that when knocked down increased neural apoptosis. Furthermore the region containing the mutated RT created a hairpin loop structure, necessary for proper function of the ncRNA \citep{Cartault2012}. 

Although there are many more examples of RTs which have evolved to create useful functions in humans, the last one I will share is that of a particular locus on chr19. This region is the source of at least 50 miRNAs, all of which are transcribed via promoters from Alu RTs . Interestingly, being promoted by Alu, these miRNAs are all Pol-III transcribed as opposed to the canonical Pol-II transcription of most miRNAs \citep{Borchert2006}.

\section{A New Path for Retrotransposon Research}

The study of the effects of RTs on genes has previously been largely hampered by inadequate methods to identify sufficient numbers RT polymorphisms. Recent advances both in sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses have enabled researchers to begin to identify polymorphic RTs and therefore to study the effect that these elements have on phenotype. In 2010 three seminal papers published in Cell and Genome Research described feasible techniques for sequencing L1 retrotransposons \citep{Ewing2010, Iskow2010, Beck2010}. Combined with an array-based technique published the following year, these methods filled in the first missing piece of identifying the contribution of RTs to human variation \citep{Baillie2011}. That was identifying the variants. Combined with novel bioinformatics algorithms to map these variations to the genome \citep{Ye2009,Chen2009} these techniques facilitated the completion of the RT portion of the 1000 genomes project, which annotated hundreds of insertions that are polymorphic between human populations. Now that the techniques are available to identify the presence or absence of RTs between individuals, it is necessary to examine the phenotypic consequences of these insertions.

        %Closing of the intro
\section{Motivation}
Herein I present an examination of the consequences of RT insertions within genes. The hypothesis examined is that, when inserted into genes, RTs affect the gene in a selectable manner. It is therefore postulated that the AS bias has arisen through selection as opposed to integration. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the sequence of the RT as well as the genomic context can modify the resulting distribution of the RT. Finally it is hypothesized that the presence of a RT is associated with changes in the phenotype of gene expression. Evidence presented herein shows that RT insertions are under negative selective pressure within genes, genetic factors modify this selection of RTs, and that there is association between RTs and differential expression of the genes they reside within. This research will aid future disease studies attempting to link genetic variability of RTs to phenotypic change by aiding the ability to annotate RT insertions as potentially deleterious based on variables such as genomic location and RT-type. These results were attained through the following specific aims:

\textbf{\\Aim 1: Determine whether RT antisense bias is due to integration or selection\\}
In order to identify the contexts that modify selection of RTs it must first be determined whether RTs are integrated uniformly within genes or if there is a bias upon integration. I will therefore identify if RTs are integrated uniformly with respect to the orientation within genes (i.e.: AS or S). This will be achieved by examining the AS bias of RTs of varying allele frequencies.

\textbf{\\Aim 2: Identify variables associated with RTs that modify RT distribution within genes\\} 
This analysis will examine which RT and gene contexts modify RT distribution within genes. The distribution of RTs will be tested against a random distribution for a variety of RT variables (e.g.: regulatory sequences) and gene contexts (e.g.: tissue-specificity of gene expression).

\textbf{\\Aim 3: Determine association between RTs and the phenotype of gene expression\\}
To further explore the potential for RTs to effect genes in a selectable manner, we will examine how RTs are associated with the phenotype of gene expression. In order to test this, I will calculate the association between RT insertions and differential gene expression between humans and well as between humans and non-human primates.
