%Intro to the intro

DNA elements capable of mobilizing and transpositioning into new genomic locations are present in almost all major groups of eukaryote\cite{Arkhipova2000}. These mobile elements are larger than the 1-20 bp of common SNPs and indels \cite{Mullaney2010}, and upon inserting into relatively vulnerable regions, can alter the stability of a gene. For example, when inserted into a conserved coding exon, a mobile element can disrupt the amino acid sequence fundamentally changing the final protein product. This was the case when an L1 retrotransposon inserted into the last exon of the tumor suppressor gene APC, triggering sporadic colorectal cancer \cite{Miki1992}. Future disease studies must be able to predict disruptions induced by mobile element insertions, similar to the now common practice of filtering on predicted effects of SNPs and indels. In the case of mobile elements, predicting disruptions is further complicated by the presence of protein binding sites contained within the sequence. These sites can impact a gene apart from the more obvious structural effects such as shifting the reading frame or increasing the size of the mRNA. Sequence motifs specific to mobile elements can induce functional changes by sequestering protein complexes such as chromatin remodellers, enhancers, and polymerases [REFs]. A long debated question in genetics is whether these attributes of mobile elements have a global effect on the genome or if they are instead largely neutral entities, with no observable benefit or detriment to the genome. Studies of the distribution of RTs within genes indicate that there is an unequal level of maintenance of RTs within genes, indicating that selection may be acting differentially on mobile elements based on genomic context. Though this indicates that there is a relationship between gene function and RTs, it is unknown what generalizable effects RTs have on genes. Here I present evidence of selective pressures shaping the RT distribution within genes, including the generalized effect of RTs on gene expression.

\section{The Dynamics of Regulating Gene Expression}
    %Body of Text
%        \large{
The genome responds to spatio-temporal and evironmental cues by regulating gene expression [REF], thereby coordinating tissue-type, stage of development, as well as responses to external stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. Regulating gene expression is a multi-facted process including chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, and post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core components of regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and enhancers, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA with the sequence: 5\rq -[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3\rq where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs can result in increased expression of the downstream gene. Other similar proteins may induce decreased expression[REF], alternative splicing [REF], or coordinated regulation with other genes [REF].

Aberrant regulation of gene expression is often associated with disease, and therefore many studies focus on the genetic determinants of altered gene expression. Variations associated with differential expression are termed expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Although these variants may occur within the coding region \cite{Delker2011}, they more commonly occur near transcription start sites and within  regulatory regions \cite{Veyrieras2008}. Despite there being many other forms of genetic variation, these eQTL studies generally examine small nucleotide variants, such as SNPs and small indels. Larger variations are often missed such as large structural rearrangements, copy number variations, and mobile element insertions. Importantly, it is these larger variations that track most with large scale changes in phenotype, such as the loss of conserved non-protein coding elements through deletions \cite{Hiller2012}. Moreover, chromosomes that have undergone large scale rearragments have a 2 fold faster protein evolution rate between humans and chimps \cite{Navarro2003}. and even differences between human and other non-human primates [].  

    
%Differential Gene Expression Between Humans and Non-human Primates
\section{Variation in Gene Expression Between Humans and Non-human Primates}

The coding genome of humans and non-human primates (NHP) are highly similar, with humans and chimps differing by only 4\% of the protein-coding regions  \cite{Varki2005}. Despite the conservation of coding sequence, many phenotypes are distintive between the two species. For example, the structure of organs such as the salt-wasting kidneys, the immune response, and social organization are variable between humans and NHPs \cite{Varki2005}. Attempts to determine the genetic differences underlying these and other phenotypic changes have revealed that not only are protein-coding sequences highly similar [REFs], but 3’-UTRs also exhibit baseline mutation rates  \cite{Li2006, Wang2007}. Gene expression levels, however, are significantly different between NHPs and humans  \cite{Blekhman2008, Gilad2006}, indicating that the regulation of gene expression may play a underlying role in the development of larger phenotypic differences. 

An example of gene expression variability between humans and NHPs is exhibited on a tissue-specific level \cite{Blekhman2008}. The highly specific structures such as [examples] of the brain have differences in expression between primate species \cite{Khaitovich2004}. Furthermore, [x] and humans differentially express genes located within the chromosome 7 Autism susceptibility locus  \cite{Navarro2012, Schneider2012}. 

Since non-coding sequences, such as transcription factor binding sites, are important for coordinating regulation of gene expresion, it is likely that they also play a large role in species-specific differential expression. Indeed, genes that have increased in expression in humans versus non-human primates are enriched for transcription factors, indicating that this level of regulation plays an important role in the differences in gene variation between species \cite{Gilad2006}.

\section{Retrotransposons}
Mobile elements are broken down into two major classes: Type I and Type II. Type I mobile elements integrate into the genome via an RNA intermediate [REF]. This is often referred to as a "copy and paste" mechanism and will be described in more detail in section \ref{sec:tprt}. Type II transposons insert through a "cut and paste" mechanism. Many subgroups of transposons underlie both Type I and Type II sets, and often have divergent evolutionary origins. The important, and sometimes described as parasitic, advantage to Type I retrotransposons (RTs) is that with each new insertion, the number of mobile elements in the host genome increases by one, thereby amplifying the number of RTs present in the genome. Conversely Type I transposons can move from one location to another, but do not have any coincident amplification associated with re-integration. Type I mobilization, hereafter referred to as retrotransposition, has resulted in RTs making up almost 40\% of the current human genome. This is striking when considering the 1.5\% of the genome made up of protein-coding sequence (33\% including introns) \cite{Lander2001}.

RTs can be further subdivided into long-terminal repeat containing RTs (LTR) and non-LTR RTs. Long-terminal repeats flank the transposon sequence and are used for integrating into the host genome [REF and more info]. LTR RTs have a similar structure to retroviruses, though LTRs are missing the envelope protein required for viral transmission. They are prolific in the primate genome, and endogenous retrovirus (ERV) is an example of a LTR RT that is prevalent in high copy numbers within the human genome.

Non-LTR RTs are the most common form of transposons in the human genome, and can trace their origin back to the primitive eukaryote \textit{Giardi lamblia}, predating the origin of viruses and LTR RTs \cite{Burke2002}. Although their origin can be traced to near the split of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, non-LTR RTs expanded to near present day levels during mammalian evolution \cite{Belancio2008}. They are inherited through mostly vertical transmission \cite{Malik1999}. In primates there are three major families of non-LTR RTs (hereafter referred to as RTs): LINE-1 (L1), Alu, and SINE-VNTR-Alu (SVA) (figure \ref{fig:l1}. RTs are either autonomous RTs or non-autonomous, indicating whether they have the ability to facilitate their own reintegration. Autonomous RTs encode a protein with both endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activity \cite{Mathias1991,Feng1996}. Without autonomous elements, the non-autonomous elements would be immobile. The non-autonomous elements have an increased affinity to bind to the retrotransposition proteins, and are therefore able to be inserted even though they do not contain the protein machinery themselves.

        \label{fig:l1}
    \end{figure}

In the present mammalian genome, Long-autonomous INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is the most prevalent autonomous element  \cite{Feng1996,Mathias1991}. The full-length L1 is approximately 6 kilobases (kb) long in humans (7.5kb in mouse) ~\ref{fig:l1}  \cite{Belancio2008}. The first 100bp are required for L1 expression and subsequent translation [REF] of the two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) \cite{Swergold1990}. It encodes a bicistronic mRNA via an internal Polymerase-II (Pol-II) promoter \cite{Minakami1992,Swergold1990}. Transcription initiates at the first basepair (bp) of the L1 sequence, thereby enabling the promoter to be mobilized upon integration of the full RT \cite{Minakami1992}. This promoter is also bidirectional and has the ability to enhance transcription upstream of the L1 sequence \cite{Matlik2006}. ORF1 has nucleic acid binding and chaperone activity, and is essential for autonomous L1 retrotransposition. ORF1p associates via a coiled-coil domain with itself to create a trimer that then binds to the L1 RNA \cite{Martin2003}. The exact role of ORF1p is currently unknown, however mutations in conserved arginine residues abolish L1 retrotransposition  These same mutations reduce ORF1p\rq s affinity for single-strand RNA, as well as DNA melting and strand-exchange ability \cite{Martin2005}. ORF1p also associates with ORF2p in the ribonucleoprotein particle that is required for functional retrotransposition, and mutations in ORFp1 disrupt the formation of this particle \cite{Doucet2010}.

The ORF2 product of L1 does most of the work in retrotransposition, encoding an endonuclease near the N-terminus, a reverse transcriptase, and a zinc-finger domain at the C-terminus \cite{Moran1996,Ostertag2001}. The reverse transcriptase is highly processive, able to copy cDNA at least five times longer than the Moloney murine leukemia viral reverse transcriptase. It has slower processivity through runs of polyG\rq s that coincide with hairpin-loop structures {Piskareva2006}. The sequence of the reverse transcriptase is highly homologous to telomerase \cite{Kopera2011}. It is thought that L1 reverse transcriptase activity, in the absence of the endonuclease, may play a role in DNA repair and telomere maintenance \cite{Kopera2011,Morrish2007}. The endonuclease is the internal portion of ORF2p. This portion of the protein has binding specificity for \rq AATTTT 'rq motifs in the target DNA, though there are other factors that modify the selection of integration sites. For example, most regions of DNA that are associated with chromatin are less likely to be nicked by the L1 endonuclease than naked DNA \cite{Cost2001}. There are some DNA sequences, however, where nicking is enhanced in the presence of chromatin\cite{Cost2001}. This finding was not surprising since the L1 endonuclease shows specificity for super-coiled DNA \cite{Feng1996}. The final portion of ORF2p is the cytosine-rich, zinc-finger-like C-terminus. Mutations in this zinc-finger domain significantly reduces retrotransposition, though not completely \cite{Moran1996}. This region binds to RNA non-specifically, and is therefore hypothesized to facilitate the non-autonomous capabilities of L1 \cite{Piskareva2013  FEBS open bio, need to add this to bib file}.  

The other two non-LTR RTs (Alu and SVA) that are most common in humans are non-autonomous, meaning they do not code the proteins required for retrotransposition. Alu is classified as a Short INterspersed Nucleotide Element (SINE). Similar SINEs exist in many species with some of the oldest members thought to be present since before the split of mammals and birds ~350 million years ago (mya)\cite{Nishihara2006}. The majority of SINEs originate from 5S-RNA or tRNA, however Alu, a primate specific RT, originates from the 7SL-RNA (7SL) (figure\ref{fig:alu_line}). 7SL is an integral component of the signal recognition particle, trafficing secretory proteins through the ER \cite{Gundelfinger1984}. It is thought that 7SL duplicated into a pseudogene called the fossil Alu monomer (FAM) \cite{Quentin1992}. FAM then underwent mutations, and subsequently amplfied as the left and right monomeric ancestors of Alu, FLAM and FRAM \cite{Quentin1992}. Eventually FLAM and FRAM were joined into a dimer by a central A-rich region which is the common ancestor of the modern Alu \cite{Quentin1992a}. The present day Alu has suceeded in hitchiking on the retrotransposition abilities of L1 to expand to millions of copies in the human genome \cite{Lander2001}. One hypothesis for the success of Alu as non-autonomous retrotransposons is the secondary structure imparted by the 7SL ancestor. 7SL has high affinity for the SRP9/14 proteins from the signal recognition particle . Dewannieux et al. hypothesized that the binding of Alu to SRP9/14 brings Alu to the ER where the L1 RNP resides, facilitating the mobility of Alu \cite{Hsu1995, Dewannieux2003}. They also posit that SRP9/14 may take over some of the roles that ORF1p plays in L1 retrotransposition. Interestingly, more recently, SRP14 has been identified as one of the factors associated with L1-ORF1p in a yeast two-hybrid screen \cite{Goodier2013}.

SVA is partially composed of Alu sequence. It is a composite element that contains regions with similarity to Alu and the human endogenous retrovirus (hERV), as well as a variable number tandem repeat region \cite{Hancks2010}. They are still active in the human genome, though at lower levels than either L1 or Alu \cite{Stewart2011}. Even younger than Alu, SVA appear to have evolved relatively recently. They are found only in primates and most commonly in humans, chimpanzee, and gorilla \cite{Zhu1994}. These elements contain all of the necessary requirements known for retrotranspostion, mainly an internal promoter, and a long polyadenylation stretch at the 3\rq -end (discussed in section \ref{sec:tprt}).


%Process of Retrotransposition
\section{Process of Retrotransposition}
\label{sec:tprt}

Alu, L1, and SVA are mobilized through the process of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) \cite{Raiz2011,Dewannieux2003,Ostertag2001}. TPRT is a method of retrotransposition, meaning that it involves an RNA-intermediate, as opposed to the cut-and-paste methods of transposition that are restricted to DNA. In humans the enzymes that carry out TPRT are encoded by the L1 retrotransposon. The process begins by the transcription of the ORF1 and ORF2 components of full-length L1. ORF2p is required for integration of L1, however it is not necessary, but enhances, the integration of Alu \cite{Wallace2008}. Alu and L1 must also be transcribed for the process of TPRT to occur. It has been hypothesized that RNA transcribed by Pol-III is integrated more quickly than Pol-II \cite{Kroutter2009}. Indeed Alu, which are transcribed by Pol-III, integrate at higher rates than that of L1, which is transcribed by Pol-II. Upon transcription of the retrotransposon RNA, the RNA is shuttled out of the nucleus where it forms an ribonucleoprotein (RNP) with the L1 ORF1p and ORF2p \cite{Doucet2010,Hohjoh1996,Kulpa2005}. A number of host factors are also be present in this RNP that contribute to mobilization. For example, PABPC1, MOV10, UPF1, and PCNA have all been identified in associated with L1 RNPs \cite{Taylor2013}. A subset of these proteins repress retrotransposition, such as MOV10 \cite{Arjan-Odedra2012}, while some of them enhance it. PABPC1 is protein that enhances retrotransposition through binding the polyadenosine (polyA) tail of mRNAs \cite{DelCampo2009}. The knockdown of polyA binding proteins such as PABPC1 has been shown to reduce retrotransposition while retaining the transcription and translation capacity of L1 \cite{Dai2012}. Interestingly, it has also been shown that retrotransposons with longer A-tails are more efficient at retrotransposition \cite{Comeaux2009}. 

Upon formation of the RNP, the complex is reintroduced into the nucleus. The process of insertion begins by the ORF2p cleaving a single stranded nick at the A-T phosphodiester bond in an \rq AATTTT\rq  motif \cite{Feng1996}. Although there are known hotspots of integration \cite{Wimmer2011}, it is still hypothesized that the selection of the \rq AATTTT\rq motif is random \cite{Ovchinnikov2001}. After the first strand is nicked, the stretch of adenosine nucelotides at the end of the mobilized RNA hybridizes to the \rq TTTT\rq s of the nicked DNA. Reverse transcription begins from this primed region, copying the retrotransposon RNA into cDNA from the 3\rq-OH end of the \rq TTTT\rq . The reverse transcription proceeds from this point. Alu are short, ~300bp elements, that are normally completely reverse transcribed. Full-length L1 however, are ~6kb in length, and the retrotransposition process does not always proceed until completion. The incomplete processing of L1 retrotransposons is termed "5\rq - transduction" and many of L1 in the human genome exist in this form at approximately 1kb in length. The conclusion of TPRT results in a duplication of the flanking DNA sequence, termed target-site duplications \cite{Kojima2010}. These regions are often used to validate whether an insertion is real, or whether it is false positive. In rare events, the process of TPRT is accompanied by structural rearrangements in the region. The link between retrotransposition and structural rearrangements will be discussed more in section \ref{sec:rear}.

%Subfamilies of Retrotransposons
\section{Subfamilies of retrotransposons}

Each RT family (ie: L1, Alu, and SVA), can be divided in subfamilies based on similar mutations in their sequence. The underlying principle of this form of grouping is that RTs within a subfamily are likely to have mobilized around the same time in evolutionary history. Eventually mutations will arise creating a new subfamily, and this subfamily will then be active in the host genome. There are highly active elements ("hot") that are responsible for most of the mobilization within subgroups. These "hot" master elements may mobilize other active elements as well, which then produce more insertions, but they account for most of the mobilization. It is thought that their retrotransposition is enhanced due to ...[WHAT?]. There are also other master elements that work at a much slower rate (stealth), perhaps with decreased selective pressure as well as the ability to mobilize new elements \cite{Cordaux2009}. 

It is estimated that L1 have 80 - 100 master elements that are still mobilizing in humans today, though this might be an underestimate since the work supporting this finding was produced from an early build of the human genome \cite{Brouha2003}. Only a small portion of these mobilization competant L1 are thought to be "hot" elements \cite{Brouha2003,Lutz2003}. The "hot" L1 in the human genome are a part of the human-specific subfamily L1-Ta\cite{Brouha2003}. L1 subfamilies have been evolving for approximately 170 million years, since before the marsupial eutherian split \cite{Smit1996}, and in a direct lineage for over 40 million years \cite{Khan2006}. The most active L1 were present in the primate genome and amplified between 40 and 12 mya \cite{Khan2006}. There are over 100 L1 subfamilies identified within humans \cite{SmitAfaHubleyRandGreen}, with the major subfamilies defined as L1M, L1P, and L1Hs. L1-Ta is the only presently active subfamily with a germline insertion rate of 1 in 270 births \cite{Ewing2011}. 

The burst of Alu mobilzation occured around 35 - 60 mya \cite{Shen1991}. There are an estimate 143 master Alu presently active in the human genome. Conversely to L1, there are multiple subfamilies underlying these elements, and there is a higher rate of total insertion (1 in 20 births). There are over 30 subfamilies of Alu with three major families, from oldest to youngest: AluJ, AluS, and AluY. Although evidence from population studies suggests that the only active subfamilies of Alu are with the AluY lineage \cite{Stewart2011}, there is some evidence to suggest that AluS may retain some ability for mobilization \cite{Bennett2008}. There are many factors associated with the propensity for an Alu sequence to survive and mobilize in the human genome. For example, an increase affinity for the SRP9/14 protein dimer enhances Alu activity \cite{Bennett2008}. Similar to other moblized elements, and increased A-tail also enhances activity \cite{Dewannieux2005,Wagstaff2012,Dai2012}. 

SVA are the youngest of the three elements, originating around 25 mya \cite{Wang2005a}, and contain very few diagnostic mutations. Due to this there are only six subfamilies of SVA. The burst of SVA transcription and concurrent mobilization may be due to the happenstance insertion of SVA near an active gene promoter \cite{Damert2009}. SVA, as a group, show remarkable ability for 5'-transduction of external gene promoters \cite{Damert2009}. The transduction of these promoters results in the mobilization of non-repetitive DNA to new genomic locations, a concept that will be revisited in section \ref{sec:rear}.


%Insertion of Retrotransposons During Primate Evolution
\section{Insertion of Retrotransposons During Primate Evolution}

As mentioned previously, the most active stage of mobilization of L1 and Alu and SVA, was during primate evolution. 
Recently, Arora et al. have shown that genes differentially expressed between human and chimp are significantly enriched for indels that contain retrotransposons (RT)  \cite{Arora2011}.

%Distribution of Retrotransposons 
%    \textnormal\Large\textit{\\\\\num{1.6 } Natural Selection and the Distribution of Retrotransposons in Genes\\}
\section{Selection and the Distribution of RTs}

    The distribution of RTs in the current human genome can indicate signs of selection, or the effect that the RT is having on the organism. RTs insert in the human genome at a rate of approximately 1 in 20 births for Alu, 1 in 270 births for L1, and 1:916 births for SVA \cite{Cordaux2006,Ewing2010,Xing2009}. New polymorphic insertions, as noted by a lack of fixation in the population, are evenly distributed throughout the genome \cite{Stewart2011}, as are young L1 present in the reference genome \cite{Ovchinnikov2001}. These findings indicate that RTs are integrated without preference across the genome. Some hotspots of insertion do exist. For example, NF1 is a hotspot for both Alu and L1 integration events \cite{Wimmer2011}. Furthermore, young RTs are often nested within older elements, which some studies have taken as indication of RTs creating hotspots for the integration of new RTs \cite{Levy2010}. Despite these limited findings of insertion hotspots, it is still accepted that RTs insert relatively randomly throughout the genome.
    
Contrary to the young elements, RTs with long residence times in a population show a non-random distribution across the genome. Aberrations in the otherwise random distribution of older elements can be taken as a sign of violations to Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium, such as local selection or genetic drift [REF]. Interestingly, Alu and L1 do not show the same trends of altered densities. Alu tend to be present in higher numbers in in GC-rich regions and to cluster with one another, whereas L1 are increased in AT-rich regions \cite{Pavlicek2001,Soriano1983}. These altered distributions of Alu and L1 indicate that there may be a selective pressure acting on RTs. The presence of a selective pressure on RTs is an important point to determine since it would mean that a) RTs exert a non-neutral effect on the genome, b) different regions of the genome may be more sensitive to RT insertions, and c) that polymorphic RTs may impart phenotypic variability to an organism. RTs therefore have the potential to account for some of the missing phenotypic heritability that is plaguing SNP studies. It is therefore important to determine the selective forces acting on RTs and which regions of the genome are more sensitive to these insertions. 

One example of a genomic force leading to the altered distribution of Alu, is the process of non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). Homologous recombination is a process of double-strand break repair that uses the availability of sister chromatids to repair the break. NAHR is similar in procedure to HR, however it uses two sequences that are similar, but not sister chromatids, to repair the broken region. NAHR therefore often results in deletions, or rearrangements. Since Alu are highly interspered and have strong homology to one another they are common substrates of NAHR \cite{Sen2006, Witherspoon2009}. It is has even been shown that this increased propensity for NAHR has resulted in Alu being responsible for a majority of the segmental duplications currently present in the human genome. Alu mediated NAHR is also responsible for many of the rearrangments present between human and non-human primates \cite{Bailey2003}. When Alu are used as substrates for NAHR, the result would be two Alu residing close to one another, rather than at farther, more random distances, and thus has been used as a hypothesis to describe the co-clustering of Alu in GC-rich regions \cite{Jurka2004}. Furthermore, the ubiquitous removal of newly inserted Alu, would reduce the load in AT-rich regions \cite{Jurka2004}.

Despite large scale rearrangments of RT densities, there is evidence of selection at the level of the individual element. One study, indicating that RTs undergo purifying selection, examined the rate of heterozygosity of polymorphic RTs in various human populations. They found that Alu and L1 are present more often in the heterozygous state than the homozygous state \cite{Stewart2011}. This deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is similar to what would be expected under purifying selection. Another study attempting to determine the selective forces on RTs examined the densities of Alu on the autosomes, chrX, and chrY seperately. The advantage to this study was that each of these chromosome groups undergo varying selective forces. One example is that autosomes, chrX, and chrY have different effective population sizes (section).

Although many groups suggest that RTs are undergoing purifying selection \cite{Jurka2004, Stewart2011}, there are also studies suggesting the potential of postive selection acting on RTs. The altered distribution of Alu in the draft reference genome with respect to GC-content intially caused speculation that RTs were under the influence of positive selection \cite{Lander2001}. A similar GC-bias is observed in B1 within mice. B1 are rodent-specific SINEs that are similar to Alu, but that are not derived from Alu. This finding of seemingly convergent evolutionary forces led the authors to claim that the distribution of Alu and B1 are present due to forces of positive selection \cite{Tsirigos2009}, though there is not much data to support the hypothesis of positive selection versus purifying selection in this case. The population genetics community responded to the claim of positive selection in the Lander et al. paper with skeptisism. Brookfield cited less complicated mechansisms as potential mediators of the altered RT distribution, such as recombination of Alu elements, hitchiker effects, and the change in GC-content over time [Cite Brookfield 2001].

One piece of evidence supporting positive selection is that specific bases within the Alu consensus sequences are mutated less often than expected at random \cite{Britten1994}. Some of these mutations, however, are necessary for Alu transcription and are thefore more likely to be maintained across subfamilies \cite{Brookfield1994}. For example, a large number of the mutations that were found were located within the Polymerase-III binding regions \cite{Britten1994}. These nucleotides would be required for retrotransposition and are therefore more likely to be present than other nucleotides. Since this original paper was published in 1994, almost a decade ahead of the draft genome sequence, it is possible that there are other nucleotides within Alu and other retrotransposon sequences are maintained that could not have been picked up with the small sample size they were working with (1500 elements) \cite{Britten1994}. It is important to revist this question with the data currently available that would facilitate analysis of the conservation of each nucleotide. [OTHER POSITIVE SELECTION]
        
        
Understanding the factors associated with these observed distribution biases could help to predict the functional impact RT insertions. Furthermore, Studying the non-random distribution of RTs within genes will provide further evidence of the selectable interaction between RT and genomic context.

Retrotransposons are more common near transcription start sites [write more from this paper!] \cite{Tsirigos2009}.


Previous studies have taken advantage of the high copy number of RTs to study the relationships of mobile elements with the host genome, revealing the capacity of various genomic contexts to withstand retrotransposition. There are 1.1e06, 9.5e05, and 3.7e03 Alu, L1, and SVA respectively annotated in the human Hg19 reference genome \cite{Kent2002}. Furthermore, the 1000 genomes project has identified [x,y,and z] Alu, L1, and SVA respectively that are segregating within humans. These segregating, or polymorphic RTs allow us to [b;a b;a b;a]. Within genes, certain regions are more susceptible to disruption by RTs than others \cite{Zhang2011}. The regions identified so far have been termed “hazardous zones,” and are highly correlated with exon density. Orientation of the RT with respect to the gene has also been determined to be an important factor in RT density. 

    %Antisense Bias 
\section{Antisense Bias of RTs in Genes}

The non-random distribution of RTs is likely a result of a combination of variables such as the selection ceofficient of the mutation, the effective population size, and the rate of recombination in the region of the mutation. Interestingly, the distributions of RTs in genes differs depending on orientation of the RT with respect to the gene. Elements in the antisense orientation (AS) with respect to a gene are more common than elements that are oriented in the sense (S) direction, termed antisense bias \cite{VanDeLagemaat2006}. When in the same region, RTs in either orientation would be expected to be undergoing similar levels of genetic drift, effects of population size, and hitchiker effects.  The varying distribution is likely the result of either selection on the RT based on the orientation, or a bias due to TPRT. Antisense bias is observed across all major human RTs as well as Type II DNA transposons. Although this indicates that AS bias is not due to TPRT, since Type II transposons do not insert via TPRT, it is still unknown whether the antisense bias (AS bias) is due to the process of integration, or is due to a mechanism of selection over time.


%Selection on the sex chromosomes versus the autosomes
\section{Selection on the sex chromosomes versus the autosomes}

The equations below show the effetive population sizes for autosomes (equation \ref{eq:auto}), chrX (equation \ref{eq:chrx}), and chrY (equation \ref{eq:chry}), where N$_{\textit{e}}$ is effective population size, N\textit{m} is the population size of males, and N\textit{f} is the population size of females. [REF, Hartl and Clark Principles of human genetics]. 

    %Effective population size : Autosome
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{4N_{\textit{m}}N_{\textit{f}}}{N_{\textit{m}} + N_{\textit{f}}}
        \label{eq:auto}
    \end{equation}

    %Effective population size : ChrX
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{9N_{\textit{m}}N_{\textit{f}}}{4N_{\textit{m}} + 2N_{\textit{f}}}
        \label{eq:chrx}
    \end{equation}
    
    %Effective population size : ChrY
    \begin{equation}
        N_{\textit{e}}  = \frac{N_{\textit{m}}}{2}
         \label{eq:chry}
    \end{equation}


N$_{\textit{e}}$ (equation \ref{rfix}) is a key determinant in the ability for selection to act over genetic drift \cite{Charlesworth2009}, and therefore the forces of selection differ depending on the chromosome on which it is acting. Another factor at play in the difference of selection between chrX and chrY is the effect termed "Muller\rq s ratchet" \cite{Muller1964}. Muller posited that recombination is highly important for purifying selection. This theory states that there is a lack of an ability to purify deleterious mutations from the genome, since the genome is inherited as a whole with each generation. The next generation then has a higher genetic load of deleterious mutations to begin with, and this mutational load is ever increasing. [MORE SENTENCES, SUPPORT FOR MULLER'S RATCHET ON CHRY]. Although many studies have shown that Muller\rq s ratchet is truely acting on chrY, some studies have shown that there are regions of purifying selection \cite{WilsonSayres2014}.

%Structural Rearrangments associated with TPRT
\section{Structural rearrangements associated with retrotransposition}
\label{sec:rear}
Other than the direct amplification of the RT, there are other structural effects, such as deletions, rearrangments, and transduction events that are associated with the process of retrotransposition. Deletions are a often result of the process of TPRT. There was an estimated 7.5 megabases (Mb) of sequence lost in primates and 18 kilobases (kb) between human and chimp due to L1 integration alone \cite{Han2005}. Large (2 -14 kb) deletions are common in cell culture \cite{Gilbert2005,Gilbert2002,Symer2002}, however studies comparing primate genomes reveal most deletions are either very small ( < 100 bp) or large (> 1 kb) \cite{Han2005}. It is possible that the discrepancy between cell culture and comparative studies is due to selection against large deletion events. Deletions occuring in cell culture range from local insertional deletions to intrachromosomal deletions \cite{Gilbert2005}. These deletions create variability in the human population, but may also be a process associated with cancer \cite{Raschke2005, Florl2003}.

Although, RTs are often integrated through the canonical mechanisms of TPRT, there is also L1 retrotransposition that is independent of the endonuclease. [go back to paper --> Endonuclease-independent LINE-1 retrotransposition at mammalian telomeres] [Go more into this and DSB]

%Retrotransposons as sources of non-coding regulation
\section{Retrotransposons as Non-coding Sources of Regulating Gene Expression}

 Retrotransposons have shaped the human genome throughout primate evolution, contributing to splice sites, coding sequence, and primate-specific enhancers [REF]. Although individual RTs accumulate mutations over time, they retain similarities to the parent RT until they have been completely mutated. The consensus sequences of the different parent RTs contain sequence motifs that can act as binding sites for transcription factors \cite{Polak2006}, polymerases \cite{Fuhrman1981,Minakami1992,Swergold1990}, polyadenylation enzymes \cite{Kaer2011}, and other  regulatory proteins. Therefore, when RTs integrate into a new location they may impact regulatory mechanisms as well as the protein coding regions of the gene. RT insertions can disrupt transcriptional regulation  \cite{Kaer2011,Speek2001,Matlik2006} and  chromatin structure \cite{Englander1995,Rebollo2011}. For example, Wang et al. showed that different fragments of the L1-ORF2 modulated transcription termination of upstream GFP expression \cite{Wang2009}, demonstrating functional impact of the L1 sequence on gene transcription without a direct disruption of coding sequence. The functional consequences of RT retrotransposition are not always deleterious, however, and in some instances they have led to the evolution of mammalian-specific \cite{Shephard2007} and human-specific traits \cite{Hayakawa2001}. On a genome-wide level, retrotransposition has been the source of novel coding sequences \cite{Yu2007}, chromatin organization \cite{Englander1995,Schmidt2012}, and tissue-specific regulation \cite{Robins1992} throughout mammalian evolution. While many of these insertions have no apparent pathological consequence, a subset are known to have deleterious effects [REF].\\

        %Closing of the intro
\section{Motivation}
Herein I present an examination of the consequences of RT insertions within genes. The hypothesis examined is that, when inserted into genes, RTs affect the gene in a selectable manner. It is therefore postulated that the AS bias has arisen through selection as opposed to integration. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the sequence of the RT as well as the genomic context can modify the resulting distribution of the RT. Finally it is hypothesized that the presence of a RT is associated with changes in the phenotype of gene expression. Evidence presented herein shows that RT insertions are under negative selective pressure within genes, genetic factors modify this selection of RTs, and that there is association between RTs and differential expression of the genes they reside within. This research will aid future disease studies attempting to link genetic variability of RTs to phenotypic change by aiding the ability to annotate RT insertions as potentially deleterious based on variables such as genomic location and RT-type. These results were attained through the following specific aims:

\textbf{\\Aim 1: Determine whether RT antisense bias is due to integration or selection\\}
In order to identify the contexts that modify selection of RTs it must first be determined whether RTs are integrated uniformly within genes or if there is a bias upon integration. I will therefore identify if RTs are integrated uniformly with respect to the orientation within genes (i.e.: AS or S). This will be achieved by examining the AS bias of RTs of varying allele frequencies.

\textbf{\\Aim 2: Identify variables associated with RTs that modify RT distribution within genes\\} 
This analysis will examine which RT and gene contexts modify RT distribution within genes. The distribution of RTs will be tested against a random distribution for a variety of RT variables (e.g.: regulatory sequences) and gene contexts (e.g.: tissue-specificity of gene expression).

\textbf{\\Aim 3: Determine association between RTs and the phenotype of gene expression\\}
To further explore the potential for RTs to effect genes in a selectable manner, we will examine how RTs are associated with the phenotype of gene expression. In order to test this, I will calculate the association between RT insertions and differential gene expression between humans and well as between humans and non-human primates.
