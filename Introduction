        \hspace{20pt}Non-coding mobile genetic elements have the potential to alter the regulation of genes. Gene expression regulation is an evolutionary conserved process that responds to complex cues such as tissue-type, stage of development, and level of cellular stress. These concerted signals direct proper growth and maintenance by supplying proteins and non-coding RNA necessary for the stability of the cell. As expected, changes in tissue-type, stage of development, and environmental cues require different genes to be expressed to properly manage the organism as a whole. This process of regulating gene expression is multi-facted including contributions from chromatin folding, transcription complex formation, and post-transcriptional degradation. One of the core processes involved in regulating gene expression is the interactive binding of multiple regulatory proteins to specific sequences within the DNA. These regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors, are structured to fold and bind specifically to predetermined sequences, or subtle variations thereof. The DNA bound protein can then recruit other enzymes to the region to modify gene expression or alter the local structure of the chromatin. For example, the RORA hormone receptor binds to DNA of the following sequence: (5'-[AT][TA]A[AT][CGT]TAGGTCA-3'), where brackets indicate positions which are recognized when any of the included nucleotides are present. The binding of RORA transcription factors to these DNA sequence motifs results in increased expression of the downstream gene. Transcription factor binding is a classic example of how gene expression is regulated, and although there are many components involved in expression, they are a likely candidate for variability [fix this last sentence, not sure what I want to say here] . \\

        \hspace{20pt}Although regulatory mechanisms are conserved, gene expression remains highly variable depending on the context of the cell. Examples of variables associated with differential expression are; DNA polymorphisms, temporal cues, tissue-type, and species of origin. Humans and non-human primates (NHP) are highly similar, with humans and chimps differing by only 4\% of the protein-coding regions  \cite{Varki2005}. Despite the conservation of coding sequence, many phenotypes are distintive between the two species. For example, the structure of organs such as the salt-wasting kidneys, the immune response, and social organization are variable between humans and NHPs \cite{Varki2005}. Attempts to determine the genetic differences underlying these and other phenotypic changes have revealed that not only are protein-coding sequences highly similar [REFs], but 3’-UTRs also exhibit baseline mutation rates  \cite{Li2006, Wang2007}. Despite similarities in coding sequence and 3'-UTRs, gene expression levels are significantly different between NHPs and humans  \cite{Blekhman2002; Gilad2006}, indicating that the regulation of gene expression may play a underlying role in creating larger phenotypic differences. 

An example of gene expression variability between humans and NHPs is exhibited on a tissue-specific level  \cite{Blekhman2008}. The highly specific structures such as [examples] of the brain have differences in expression between primate species  \cite{Khaitovich2004}. Furthermore, [x] and humans differentially express genes located within the chromosome 7 Autism susceptibility locus  \cite{Navarro2012, Schneider2012}. 

Since non-coding sequences, such as transcription factor binding sites, are important for coordinating regulation of gene expresion, it is likely that they also play a large role in species-specific differential expression. Indeed, genes that have increased in expression in humans versus non-human primates are enriched for transcription factors, indicating that this level of regulation plays an important role in the differences in gene variation between species \cite{Gilad2006}.

Recently, Arora et al. have shown that genes differentially expressed between human and chimp are significantly enriched for indels that contain retrotransposons (RT)  \cite{Arora, 2011}. RTs are Type I mobile DNA elements that integrate into the genome via an RNA intermediate [REF]. Sometimes this is referred to as a "copy and paste" mechanism, as opposed to Type II transposons that insert through a "cut and paste" mechanism. The important, and sometimes described as parasitic, advantage to Type I retrotransposition is that with each new insertion, the number of mobile elements in the host genome increases by one, thereby amplifying the number of RTs present in the genome. This method of amplification has resulted in retrotransposons making up almost 40\% of the current human genome. This is striking when considering the 1.5\% of the genome made up of protein-coding sequence (33\% when including introns) \cite{Lander2001}.

In primates there are three major families of RTs: LINE-1 (L1), Alu, and SVA. These can be split up into two groups, i.) autonomous RTs and ii.) non-autonomous RTs. Autonomous RTs encode the endonuclease and reverse transcriptase that are required for retrotransposition. Without autonomous elements, the non-autonomous elements would be immobile. The non-autonomous elements have an increased affinity to bind to the retrotransposition proteins, and are therefore able to be inserted even though they do not contain the protein machinery themselves. In the present mammalian genome, Long-autonomous INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1, L1) is the most prevalent autonomous element  \cite{Feng1996,Mathias1991}. The full-length L1 is approximately 6 kilobases (kb) long and encodes two open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) flanked by a promoter on the 5'-end and an A-rich tail on the 3'-end~\ref{fig:l1}  \cite{Scott1987}. ORF2 does most of the work, encoding both the endonuclease and the reverese transcriptase [REF, is this true?]. ORF1 is not necessary for the mobilization of non-autonomous elements, but is required for the mobilization of L1. Although L1 is present in all mammals currently studied, each species has a distinctive sequence of L1 \cite{Scott1987}. The 5'-region is less conserved and contains regions with higher GC-content and with homology to the non-autonomous RT Alu. 

Alu is a non-autonomous RT that has suceeded in hitchiking on the retrotransposition abilities of L1 to expand to millions of copies in the human genome  \cite{Lander2001}. It is thought that Alu began as a 7SL-RNA. 7SL is an integral component of the signal recognition particle, trafficing secretorty proteins through the ER  \cite{Gundelfinger1984}. It is thought that 7SL duplicated into a pseudogene, underwent mutations, and subsequently amplfied as the monomeric ancestors of Alu, FLAM and FRAM  \cite{Roy-engel2008}. Eventually two of these monomeric ancestors were joined into a dimer by a central A-rich region. Recent evidence has shown that Alu retain some of the binding potential of the original 7SL RNA. [More on this].

Retrotransposition begins from a polyA stretch within the RT that is often found at the 3’ end of the RNA. L1-ORF2 encodes an endonuclease that cuts ‘AATTTT’ sites at the phosphodiester bond between the adenosine and thymine [REF]. This creates a “TTTT” overhang that RNAs with polyA stretches can bind to. ORF2 also codes for a retrotransposase that then initiates reverse transcription of the RNA from the TTTT/AAAA primed region [REF]. The completed process is termed target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT).
Since full-length L1 are approximately 6 kb long, TPRT does not always proceed to completion, leaving many truncated L1 in the genome [REF].

RTs can influence the regulation of gene expression. Although individual RTs accumulate mutations over time,
they retain similarities to the parent RT until they have been completely mutated. The consensus sequences of the different parent RTs contain sequence motifs that can act as binding sites for transcription factors \cite{Polak2006}, polymerases \cite{Fuhrman1981,Minakami1992,Swergold1990}, polyadenylation enzymes \cite{Kaer2011}, and other  regulatory proteins. Therefore, when RTs integrate into a new location they may impact regulatory mechanisms as well as the protein coding regions of the gene. RT insertions can disrupt transcriptional regulation  \cite{Kaer2011,Speek2001,Matlik2006} and  chromatin structure \cite{Englander1995,Rebollo2011}. For example, Wang et al. showed that different fragments of the L1-ORF2 modulated transcription termination of upstream GFP expression \cite{Wang2009}, demonstrating functional impact of the L1 sequence on gene transcription without a direct disruption of coding sequence. The functional consequences of RT retrotransposition are not always deleterious, however, and in some instances they have led to the evolution of mammalian-specific \cite{Shephard2007} and human-specific traits \cite{Hayakawa2001}. On a genome-wide level, retrotransposition has been the source of novel coding sequences \cite{Yu2007}, chromatin organization \cite{Englander1995,Schmidt2012}, and tissue-specific regulation \cite{Robin1992} throughout mammalian evolution. While many of these insertions have no apparent pathological consequence, a subset are known to have deleterious effects [REF].

Retrotransposons have shaped the human genome throught primate evolution. L1 are present in all mammals that have been studied \cite{Singer1985}.The majority of L1 arose within the past 30 million years \cite{Scott1987}. Alu arose through the joining of two 7SL-RNA -like sequences within the primate lineage. Alu then substantially amplified during the period when the AluS subfamily was the most active, approximately 30 - 50 million years ago [REF, more information]. The human-specific L1 subfamily L1Hs has a portion of its sequence that is not conserved across other species, but which has a GC-rich region with high homology to AluI repeats (reword AluI??) \cite{Scott1987}.

contributing regulatory regions as well as exon sequences to the human genome. Different primate lineages have experienced not only insertions at different loci, but also different rates of RT insertion. For example AluYb8 has amplified at a higher rate in X than Y, and SVA is almost completely absent from Rhesus Macaque,

Although host mechanisms inhibit their amplification rate \cite{Liu1994,Muckenfuss2006,Vagin2006}, human RTs maintain an insertion rate of approximately 1 in 20 births for Alu, 1 in 270 births for L1, and 1:916 births for SVA \cite{Cordaux2006,Ewing2010,Xing2009}.

The distribution of RTs provides evidence of the selectable interaction between RT and genomic context. Variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels are expected to occur randomly throughout the genome \cite{Mills2006}. Aberrations in the otherwise random distribution are signs of violations of Hardy-Weinburg equilibrium, such as local selection or genetic drift. RTs are also assumed to insert randomly since the required 'TTAAAA' binding site is present throughout the genome [REF]. The cross-sectional view in time of RTs is a non-random distribution.

Alu and L1 RTs are distributed non-randomly in the human genome. Alu and L1 initially insert randomly across the genome, but they tend to accumulate in GC-rich and GC-poor regions, respectively \cite{Pavlicek2001,Soriano1983}. Understanding the factors associated with this observed distribution could help to predict how the functional impact of a given RT insert is determined by its surrounding genomic context. Previous studies have taken advantage of the high copy number of RTs to study their relationship with the host genome. These studies have begun to reveal the capacity of various genomic contexts to withstand retrotransposition. Within genes, certain regions are more susceptible to disruption by RTs than others \cite{Zhang2011}. These regions have been termed “hazardous zones,” and are highly correlated with exon density. Orientation of the RT with respect to the gene has also been determined to be an important factor in RT frequency. In order to characterize the relationship between genes and inserted elements, we have examined the distribution of RTs and their internal motifs within tissue-specific and housekeeping genes. We further explored the functional relationship with gene expression by examining whether polymorphic RTs can act as expressed quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for co-localized genes. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) oriented in the sense orientation (SO) with respect to a gene are reduced within genes compared to ERVs in the antisense orientation (ASO) \cite{VanDeLagemaat2006}. This pattern has also been observed in Alu and L1 \cite{Chen2009,Medstrand2002}.

The non-random distribution of RTs is likely a result of a combination of variables such as the selection ceofficient of the mutation, the effective population size, and the rate of recombination in the region of the mutation. Interestingly, the differing distributions of RTs depending on orientation occurs within the same region of a gene. When in the same region, RTs in either orientation would be expected to be undergoing similar levels of genetic drift, effects of population size, and hitchiker effects with other deleterious or advantageous alleles. The varying distribution between antisense and sense oriented RTs therefore must be the result of either selection on the RT, or a bias due to the integration process of retrotransposition.

One hypothesis proposed for this antisense bias is that SO RTs contain sequence motifs such as those that alter splicing and polyadenylation \cite{Speek2001,VanDeLagemaat2006}, and therefore are more deleterious in the SO \cite{Han2004}.
