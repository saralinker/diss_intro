\chapter{Discussion}

Genomic studies have been sucessful in identifying a portion of the heritable component of complex human diseases. Despite these sucesses, there remains a large proportion of the heritability of complex diseases which has yet to be explained by specific genetic variations. Genetic variations studied in genomics commonly take the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions\slash deletions (indels), and large copy number variations (CNVs).  There are many reasons why the heritable portion of complex disease etiology remains elusive. One reason in particular being the stringent prior assumptions that geneticists make in order to make analyses more tractable. Perhaps the most pertinent to this study are the assumptions that result in the exclusion of retrotransposons (RTs) from analysis.

RTs are both a common source of heritable variation, and are capable of substantially distrupting gene function. For these reasons they are prime candidates for genetic variation that contribute to human disease. RTs, however, currently remain an under-examined source of phenotypic variation. The lack of research in this area is largely due to a lack of appropriate methodology and difficulty in interpreting the results. The lack of appropriate methodology stems from the highly repetitive and highly homologous sequence of RTs. These features of RTs make them difficult to map to the reference genome when using modern short-read sequencing. Recent advances both in long read sequencers and clever bioinformatics mapping strategies have begun to advance this area of RT research, and therefore methodology was not the focus of this study.

The second problem of interpretation remains a more difficult problem [ech the wording here!!]. Sucesses have been made regarding this question in the decades since the discovery of RTs. Importantly, \textit{in vitro} studies have established a host of effects that RTs can have on genes such as reduced expression or altering translation. Moreover, \textit{in silico} studies have identified a subset of genome-wide trends that hint at potential functional implications of RT insertions. Despite these advances, the difficulty in interpreting the effects of RTs remains. Thid difficulty stems from the ambiguity of a RT insertion. RTs contain many structural features ranging purley from the size of the insertion, to the AT-content, to specific protein binding motifs contained within the sequence. All of these features will disrupt the genome in varying ways depending largely on the genomic environment in which they insert. It was this ambiquity of RTs, this inability to predict the functional consequence of RT insertions on the genome that this study attempted to resolve.

Since the difficulty in predicting effects of RTs stems from the interaction between the RT element and the genomic context, it was important to examine the roles of both of these factors on the effect of RTs on genes. The ability to measure the output of the "effect" of a RT on a gene was the first challenge met in this project. Two outputs were selected as measures in these experiments. The first output i.) was the force of selection on a RT and the second output ii.) was the phenotypic change of gene expression. This resulted in an ability to distinguish the strength of an effect of a RT over long periods of evolution, as well as a phenotypic change to validate the assumptions made by the initial findings. Together the studies both resulted in findings that suggested that RTs are not only capable of altering genes in a phenotypically selectable manner, but that many RTs are variable in the current human population that are associated with these changes.

The chosen measure for output i: force of selection was the distribution of the RTs in the genome. Before we could measure the first output (i: force of selection) we needed to convince ourselves that the distribution of RTs in the genome were established by selection and not by integration. This was shown by analyzing the antisense bias (AS bias) of RTs. AS bias was chosen because it resulted in a high-powered analysis that could be studied across every gene and across every element type. We showed here that indeed AS bias was not due to integration but was due to a selective force. This selective force acted relatively quickly for Alu as well as L1, however with L1 there were signs of changes in AS bias extending over relatively long periods of evolutionary time. This indicated that the distribution of at least one variable associated with RTs was due to selection. 

It must be noted that we did not examine the evidence of selection for variables other than the AS bias. It is possible that AS bias is due to selection while the other biases (ie: tissue-specific patterns of distribution and binding motif preference) were due to integration rather than selection. Regarding the binding motifs, this is possible, though highly unlikely since the process of retrotransposition does not involve the internal binding motifs. Regarding tissue-specificity the possibility of integration bias is a bit more palpable. Since retrotransposition is influenced by chromatin dynamics, the structure of chromatin in the germ cell, specifically in the male germ cells, may play a role in bias of the number of insertions in different regions. 

It must also be noted that we did not examine the effects of genetic drift on RT distribution. Genetic drift and population bottlenecks could lead to local alterations in the distributions of RTs. The reason that this was not accounted for this this study was because local effects of genetic drift would not be able to distinguish the orientation of an element. Therefore the observed bias of antisense and sense RTs is not likely to be an effect of genetic drift, and this was the variable that we studied to determine if RT distribution was due to selection.

Evidence of natural selection is a indicator of the functionality of a region, or of it's usefulness to an organism. Regions that are highly conserved between species are more likely to provide some function to the organism. I was therefore able to use evidence of selection as a way to evaluate the potential for retrotransposons to have a phenotypic effect on the organism (or population) in which they've inserted. The idea behind this analysis was that RTs should be present in a random distribution throughout the genome. Of course there are hotspots of integration, but taking these into account, there should generally be a random distribution of elements. So....if I found regions that were increased about the random expectation, that would lead me to hypothesize that RTs were having a positive effect in that region. Conversely, and more commonly, if I found a region where RTs were present below what would be expected by chance, then I would have to assume that the RTs in that region were having some sort of deleterious effect.

There were many situations where RTs were decreased beyond what would be expected based on intergenic values. The most significant situation was where the RT was present in the sense orientation with respect to the coding gene's direction of transcription. It is possible that RTs in the sense orientation inhibit expression moreso than RTs in the antisense orientation. This is because Retrotransposons contain runs of A's in the sense orientation which polymerase II has trouble going through. Therefore the insertion of a RT in the sense orientation may decrease transcription of the coincident gene and therefore result in a selectable change in the phenotype of gene expression.

Interestingly the effect resulting in AS bias was stronger for L1 than for Alu. At first glance one might think that this is because of the difference in size between L1 (6kb) and Alu (300bp), however most L1 in the reference genome are far less than even 1kb in length, and Alu contain multiple regions of polyA's within their consensus sequences. An alternative reason for the significant difference in reduction of L1 in the sense orientation compared to Alu in the sense orientation is that L1 contain a strong polyadenylation sequence near the 3\rq end of the element. The studies here showing the basewise conservation of polyadenylation sequence in L1 and Alu showed that polyadenylation sequences within L1 in the sense orientation were much less conserved overall than either L1 in the antisense orientation or Alu. This indicated that the polyadenylation seuqence within sense oriented L1 may be leading to the reduced quantity of sense L1. Interestingly, there are still many L1 in the sense orienation that contain polyadenylation sequences. It is possible that the human genome has not undergone purifying selection to rid these sequences because they are not functional. Also, however, it is possible that some of the L1-contained polyadenylation sequences in the human genome have been expated to serve a function. Future studies should look at the polyadenylation sequences that are not conserved among species to determine if they have developed a human specific function.  

The advantange of this studying selection with respect to RTs was that this allowed me to take a look at the different variables associated with retrotransposons or different regions of the genome and to deterimine which regions had the largest "effect" on phenotype. Although I can't say "effect" directly with this analysis, the idea that selection was playing a role, necessitates that some sort of phenotypic effect is occuring (sans genetic drify. byt bla bla bla ).

Importantly this analysis showed us that RTs are commonly removed from within genes, or undergo purifying selection. Previously it was thought that retrotransposons are increased near genes because they were conferring some sort of selective advantage to the gene. The research presented here shows the opposite. There was an increase of retrotransposons in certain regions of genes. Though, we found that this wasn't so much an increase of retrotransposons as much as a lack of purifying selection of the retrotransposon. 

More specifically, we saw that Alu and L1 had different strengths of selective pressure acting on them. Both Alu and L1 were undergoing purifying selection, but L1 exhibited larger effects of purifying selection than Alu did. This was evidenced by the greater antisense bias in L1 compared to Alu as well as the constant change in L1 frequency over time, while Alu maintained a relatively constant density. It is possible that the change in frequency of L1 indicates a two-step process of selection, where the first step is similar to what is observed for Alu. That is that if Alu or L1 insert into a gene, they effect the gene either by distrupting coding sequence, or reducing transcription through the runs of polyA's. This would lead to a large selection coefficient and a low probablity of fixation. The elements that effect a gene in this way would be selected upon quickly, in the "first round". Then if there are other smaller effects that the RT has on a gene, this would be selected on with a smaller selection coefficient and therefore would have the potential to change the distribution of the element over long periods of time. It is possible that Alu and L1 both undergo this initial large selection, and that only L1 undergo the second, lower level selection.

This makes biological sense since L1 are transcribed by polymerase-II and therefore contain more binding motifs that can distrupt Pol-II transcription of neighboring genes than Alu. For example, L1 contains polyadenylation sequence as well as a pol-II promoter.

Even if this two step process isn't true, our results still show that Alu seem to be under lower levels of selection than L1. This is important because that means that when Alu insert into a new region they may be less likley to be deleterious than an L1. Perhaps Alu can be maintained over longer periods of time than L1 because of the reduced negative load. This would therefore give Alu more time, and more chances, to be co-opted to serve a function for the gene in which it inserted. This is evidenced by the fact that many Alu are included into coding region through alternative splicing. This effect speaks to a potential advantageous role of RTs in the human genome. 

Interestingly, there were some subfamilied of L1 that showed signs of positive selection when compared to intergenic L1. This was only seen when the element was in the antisense orientation when compared to the gene. This further supports the hypothesis that when the element is not too detrimental, it may confer some selective advantage to the gene, as opposed to the more normal disadvantage of most elements.  

%---> Talk about how AS L1 were sometimes older than intergenic L1 (even when first separated by subfamily). Talk about how sense L1 on chrY were much younger than expected, and talk about how L1 is though to play an active role in X-inactivation. Talk about the potential of using the older L1 as a prediction tool to identify functional roles of L1.

In the near future I would like to use this knowledge to create predictions of RT frequency in the human genome for every known RT. I think it would be possible to create a value for each RT that represents the likelihood that that retrotransposon should exist given the trends based on genomic averages. If a RT has a really low score, but exists in the human genome, perhaps that RT has an effect on the genome that should be tested, or at least catalouged so when variants arise in the gene it can be noted for disease studies. 

The selection coefficient on a retrotransposon is suggestive of the effect of the retrotransposon on the gene. Retrotransposons are complex elements that can have a multitude of effects on genes, some of which were analyzed in this study. The most basic of these was the association of retrotransposons with a decrease in the level of gene expression. The interesting thing about this finding was that gene expression seemed to be reduced mostly in males. This is interesting for a few reasons. First of all, the fact that there is a difference in the effect of the RT on gene expression based on sex indicates that there may be sex-specific binding elements within the RT that are effecting transcription. RTs are known to contain hormone response elements within their consensus sequences, which could be the mediators of this response. The interesting thing, however is that these hormone response elements respond largely to estrogen. Therefore, even though we see the effect in males, this does not prohibit the fact that there might also be a sex-specific effect in females that may be being hidden by other variables, such as overall reduced expression due to the stretches of polyAs.
