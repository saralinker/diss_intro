\chapter{Discussion}

\section{missing heritability}
Genomic studies have been sucessful in identifying a portion of the heritable component of complex human diseases. Despite these sucesses, there remains a large proportion of the heritability of complex diseases which has yet to be explained by specific genetic variations. Genetic variations studied in genomics commonly take the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions\slash deletions (indels), and large copy number variations (CNVs).  There are many reasons why the heritable portion of complex disease etiology remains elusive. One reason in particular being the stringent prior assumptions that geneticists make in order to make analyses more tractable. Perhaps the most pertinent to this study are the assumptions that result in the exclusion of retrotransposons (RTs) from analysis.

\section{retrotransposons as answer to missing heritability}
RTs are both a common source of heritable variation, and are capable of substantially distrupting gene function. For these reasons they are prime candidates for genetic variation that contribute to human disease. RTs, however, currently remain an under-examined source of phenotypic variation. The lack of research in this area is largely due to a lack of appropriate methodology and difficulty in interpreting the results. The lack of appropriate methodology stems from the highly repetitive and highly homologous sequence of RTs. These features of RTs make them difficult to map to the reference genome when using modern short-read sequencing. Recent advances both in long read sequencers and clever bioinformatics mapping strategies have begun to advance this area of RT research, and therefore methodology was not the focus of this study.

\section{problem with using RTs is interpreting the findings}
The problem of interpreting the effects of RT variants remains difficult problem to overcome. Sucesses have been made regarding this question in the decades since the discovery of RTs. Importantly, \textit{in vitro} studies have established a host of effects that RTs can have on genes such as reduced expression or altering translation. Moreover, \textit{in silico} studies have identified a subset of genome-wide trends that hint at potential functional implications of RT insertions. Despite these advances, the difficulty in interpreting the effects of RTs remains. This difficulty stems from the ambiguity of a RT insertion. RTs contain many structural features ranging purley from the size of the insertion, to the AT-content, to specific protein binding motifs contained within the sequence. All of these features will disrupt the genome in varying ways depending largely on the genomic environment in which they insert. It was this ambiquity of RTs, this inability to predict the functional consequence of RT insertions on the genome that this study attempted to resolve.

\section{Ways to measure the effect of RTs on genes using evolutionary trends and phenotypes so that we can predict the effects of new insertions} 
Since the difficulty in predicting effects of RTs stems from the interaction between the RT element and the genomic context, it was important to examine the roles of both of these factors on the effect of RTs on genes. The ability to measure the output of the "effect" of a RT on a gene was the first challenge met in this project. Two outputs were selected as measures in these experiments. The first output i.) was the force of selection on a RT and the second output ii.) was the phenotypic change of gene expression. This resulted in an ability to distinguish the strength of an effect of a RT over long periods of evolution, as well as a phenotypic change to validate the assumptions made by the initial findings. Together the studies both resulted in findings that suggested that RTs are not only capable of altering genes in a phenotypically selectable manner, but that many RTs are variable in the current human population that are associated with these changes.

\section{output i: force of selection}
The chosen measure for output i: force of selection was the distribution of the RTs in the genome. Before we could measure the first output (i: force of selection) we needed to convince ourselves that the distribution of RTs in the genome were established by selection and not by integration. This was shown by analyzing the antisense bias (AS bias) of RTs. AS bias was chosen because it resulted in a high-powered analysis that could be studied across every gene and across every element type. We showed here that indeed AS bias was not due to integration but was due to a selective force. This selective force acted relatively quickly for Alu as well as L1, however with L1 there were signs of changes in AS bias extending over relatively long periods of evolutionary time. This indicated that the distribution of at least one variable associated with RTs was due to selection. 

\section{selection as non-random distribution}
Evidence of natural selection is a indicator of the functionality of a region, or of it's usefulness to an organism. Regions that are highly conserved between species are more likely to provide some function to the organism. I was therefore able to use evidence of selection as a way to evaluate the potential for retrotransposons to have a phenotypic effect on the organism (or population) in which they've inserted. The idea behind this analysis was that RTs should be present in a random distribution throughout the genome. Of course there are hotspots of integration, but taking these into account, there should generally be a random distribution of elements. So....if I found regions that were increased about the random expectation, that would lead me to hypothesize that RTs were having a positive effect in that region. Conversely, and more commonly, if I found a region where RTs were present below what would be expected by chance, then I would have to assume that the RTs in that region were having some sort of deleterious effect.

\section{decrease in RTs beyond expectation}
Importantly this analysis showed us that RTs are commonly removed from within genes, or undergo purifying selection. Previously it was thought that retrotransposons are increased near genes because they were conferring some sort of selective advantage to the gene. The research presented here shows the opposite. There was an increase of retrotransposons in certain regions of genes. Though, we found that this wasn't so much an increase of retrotransposons as much as a lack of purifying selection of the retrotransposon. There were many situations where RTs were decreased beyond what would be expected based on intergenic values. The most significant situation was where the RT was present in the sense orientation with respect to the coding gene's direction of transcription. It is possible that RTs in the sense orientation inhibit expression moreso than RTs in the antisense orientation. This is because Retrotransposons contain runs of A's in the sense orientation which polymerase II has trouble going through. Therefore the insertion of a RT in the sense orientation may decrease transcription of the coincident gene and therefore result in a selectable change in the phenotype of gene expression.

\section{signs of positive selection}
Interestingly, there were some subfamilied of L1 that showed signs of positive selection when compared to intergenic L1. This was only seen when the element was in the antisense orientation when compared to the gene. This further supports the hypothesis that when the element is not too detrimental, it may confer some selective advantage to the gene, as opposed to the more normal disadvantage of most elements. 

\section{difference in degree of selection between Alu and L1}
Interestingly the effect resulting in AS bias was stronger for L1 than for Alu. At first glance one might think that this is because of the difference in size between L1 (6kb) and Alu (300bp), however most L1 in the reference genome are far less than even 1kb in length, and Alu contain multiple regions of polyA's within their consensus sequences. An alternative reason for the significant difference in reduction of L1 in the sense orientation compared to Alu in the sense orientation is that L1 contain a strong polyadenylation sequence near the 3\rq end of the element. The studies here showing the basewise conservation of polyadenylation sequence in L1 and Alu showed that polyadenylation sequences within L1 in the sense orientation were much less conserved overall than either L1 in the antisense orientation or Alu. This indicated that the polyadenylation seuqence within sense oriented L1 may be leading to the reduced quantity of sense L1. Interestingly, there are still many L1 in the sense orienation that contain polyadenylation sequences. It is possible that the human genome has not undergone purifying selection to rid these sequences because they are not functional. Also, however, it is possible that some of the L1-contained polyadenylation sequences in the human genome have been expated to serve a function. Future studies should look at the polyadenylation sequences that are not conserved among species to determine if they have developed a human specific function.  

More specifically, we saw that Alu and L1 had different strengths of selective pressure acting on them. Both Alu and L1 were undergoing purifying selection, but L1 exhibited larger effects of purifying selection than Alu did. This was evidenced by the greater antisense bias in L1 compared to Alu as well as the constant change in L1 frequency over time, while Alu maintained a relatively constant density. It is possible that the change in frequency of L1 indicates a two-step process of selection, where the first step is similar to what is observed for Alu. That is that if Alu or L1 insert into a gene, they effect the gene either by distrupting coding sequence, or reducing transcription through the runs of polyA's. This would lead to a large selection coefficient and a low probablity of fixation. The elements that effect a gene in this way would be selected upon quickly, in the "first round". Then if there are other smaller effects that the RT has on a gene, this would be selected on with a smaller selection coefficient and therefore would have the potential to change the distribution of the element over long periods of time. It is possible that Alu and L1 both undergo this initial large selection, and that only L1 undergo the second, lower level selection. This makes biological sense since L1 are transcribed by polymerase-II and therefore contain more binding motifs that can distrupt Pol-II transcription of neighboring genes than Alu. For example, L1 contains polyadenylation sequence as well as a pol-II promoter.

\section{Potential for Alu to be co-opted to serve a function in the genome}
Even if this two step process isn't true, our results still show that Alu seem to be under lower levels of selection than L1. This is important because that means that when Alu insert into a new region they may be less likley to be deleterious than an L1. Perhaps Alu can be maintained over longer periods of time than L1 because of the reduced negative load. This would therefore give Alu more time, and more chances, to be co-opted to serve a function for the gene in which it inserted. This is evidenced by the fact that many Alu are included into coding region through alternative splicing. This effect speaks to a potential advantageous role of RTs in the human genome. 

\section{caveats}
It must be noted that we did not examine the evidence of selection for variables other than the AS bias. It is possible that AS bias is due to selection while the other biases (ie: tissue-specific patterns of distribution and binding motif preference) were due to integration rather than selection. Regarding the binding motifs, this is possible, though highly unlikely since the process of retrotransposition does not involve the internal binding motifs. Regarding tissue-specificity the possibility of integration bias is a bit more palpable. Since retrotransposition is influenced by chromatin dynamics, the structure of chromatin in the germ cell, specifically in the male germ cells, may play a role in bias of the number of insertions in different regions. 

It must also be noted that we did not examine the effects of genetic drift on RT distribution. Genetic drift and population bottlenecks could lead to local alterations in the distributions of RTs. The reason that this was not accounted for this this study was because local effects of genetic drift would not be able to distinguish the orientation of an element. Therefore the observed bias of antisense and sense RTs is not likely to be an effect of genetic drift, and this was the variable that we studied to determine if RT distribution was due to selection.

 \section{output ii: gene expression}
 Its all fine and dandy to use selection as a way to measure the effects of RTs on the genome, but what if the effects that led to the current distribution are no longer present? This is where looking at the current output of gene expression comes in. It is a direct way....or somewhat direct way to take a look at the effects of retrotransposons on genes.
 
 \section{using in silico versus mutation approaches}
 Even though we didn't do mutation assays, looking at gene expression the way we did was very good. yay! What we did was we took advantage of the annotations of RTs in humans. The varability of these insertions allowed for hundreds of tests on genes with at least 60 people underlying each comparison combined.
 
 \section{overall decrease in expression with RTs present}
 The results of this analysis showed that RT polymorphisms are associated with a decrease in gene expression. Interestingly, though, this was not true of all genes, indicating that there are other variables that are not being taken into account. Again, this harkens back to the analyses in chapter 2 that showed that the effect of RTs is largely contingent upon the context in which they insert. For example, the orientation with repsect to the gene, the proximity to a 5\rq -UTR, the proximity to a coding sequence, and the and the gene type in which they insert. Unfourtunately there was not a large enough sample size of elements that also had expression values to calculate the effect of these variables on gene expression. In the future, when more data on RT polymorphisms becomes available, associations between these subtle variations and gene expression should be further explored. 
 
 \section{RT variables associated with decreased expression}
 Also, most of the associations came from Alu as opposed to L1 or SVA. It is possible that Alu, L1, and SVA all have effects on gene expression, but that they are only observed in Alu in this analysis. For example, we saw in the section on selection that L1 seem to have a higher selective coefficient than Alu. If L1 have a larger effect on gene expression than Alu, then perhaps they do not survive in the population, and therefore they were not observed in this analysis. Converesely, and consistent with the hypothesis presented earlier, perhaps Alu have a smaller, but present, impact on gene expression. Therefore they are passed on through the population due to a low selective coefficient, and we can observe the effect when present. Regarding SVA, it is possible that these elements have an effect on genes that was not detected since SVA occur at much lower levels in the genome than the other elements. This reduction in sample size reduces the power to detect any significant results with small effect sizes. 

\section{sex-specificity of decrease in expression}
Perhaps the most intriguing finding was that the decrease in expression associated with RTs was sex-specific.The interesting thing about this finding was that gene expression seemed to be reduced mostly in males. This is interesting for a few reasons. First of all, the fact that there is a difference in the effect of the RT on gene expression based on sex indicates that there may be sex-specific binding elements within the RT that are effecting transcription. RTs are known to contain hormone response elements within their consensus sequences, which could be the mediators of this response. The interesting thing, however is that these hormone response elements respond largely to estrogen. Therefore, even though we see the effect in males, this does not prohibit the fact that there might also be a sex-specific effect in females that may be being hidden by other variables, such as overall reduced expression due to the stretches of polyAs.

\section{sex-specific factors within Alu}
The known sex-specific factors that are contained within Alu are the RORA-1 response elements and the DR-2 elements, though there is the potential that there are other binding motifs or sex-specific effects of Alu that are currently unknown.

\section{The potential link between Alu and Autism Spectrum Disorder}

In the analyses of altered gene expression in association with retrotransposon polymorphisms, we found that there was a significant overlap between genes that were differentially expressed, and genes that serve a brain specific function. Even more interesting was the finding that these genes were signficantly enriched for genes that have been previously associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A somewhat boring explanation for this could be that brain genes are larger on average than most genes [Need to do a caclulation if I insert at random what would i expect NEEED TO DO THIS], therefore it would be more likely that a RT would insert within these genes than within any other gene. [THIS WAS TESTED AND BLA EXPLANATION]. One level above that would be that genes which are expressed in the brain are also expressed in the testis (GERM CELL THOUGH?). In order for a mutation to be passed down to the next generation it would have to occur in the germ line. Therefore if there is a chromatin bias to the insertion mechanism, then perhaps there is an increased likelihood for inserting into testis genes, and therefore brain genes. THe problem with this hypothesis is that testis genes are not enriched in the gene set that we have looked in. So this in not likely the answer.

However you look at it, though, there is an increase of RTs in brain genes. There is no thought that is is due to some guided pre-meditated force directing integration. HOWever, once the insertions are there, perhaps they co-opt some sort of function.

\section{Future goals}
In the near future I would like to use this knowledge to create predictions of RT frequency in the human genome for every known RT. I think it would be possible to create a value for each RT that represents the likelihood that that retrotransposon should exist given the trends based on genomic averages. If a RT has a really low score, but exists in the human genome, perhaps that RT has an effect on the genome that should be tested, or at least catalouged so when variants arise in the gene it can be noted for disease studies.
