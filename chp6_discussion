\section{Motivation}
Genomic studies have been sucessful in characterizing a portion of the heritable component of complex human diseases. Using genome-wide association studies disease-associated regions have been identified such as the human leukocyte antigen in association with Multiple Sclerosis and Complement Factor H in relation to Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Despite these sucesses, there remains a large proportion of the heritability of complex diseases which has yet to be explained. There are many reasons why the heritable portion of complex disease etiology remains elusive. One reason in particular being the stringent prior assumptions that geneticists make in order to make analyses more tractable. Perhaps the most pertinent to this study are the assumptions that result in the exclusion of retrotransposons (RTs) from analysis. 

RTs are both common sources of heritable variation, and are capable of substantially distrupting gene function. For these reasons they are prime candidates for genetic variation that contribute to human disease. Current studies, however, focus on other forms of genetic variation such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion \slash deletions, and large copy number variations. RTs therefore remain an under-examined source of phenotypic variation. The lack of research into the phenotypic associations with RTs is largely due to two major factors.  These are 1.) limitations in the methodology used to identify RT variants and 2.) difficulty in interpreting the effects of RT variants on the genome.

The lack of appropriate methodology stems from the highly repetitive and highly homologous sequence of RTs. Alu RTs, for example, exist in millions of copies throughout the human genome. These Alu elements have homology both to the many other copies of Alu, as well as to repetition within the individual element itself. These repetitive features of RTs make them difficult to map to the reference genome when using modern short-read sequencing. Recent advances both in long read sequencers and clever bioinformatics mapping strategies have begun to advance the ability to map RTs to the reference genome. Due to the advancing technology of annotating RTs, the problem of limited methodology was not the focused on in this study.

The second problem that limits the study of RTs with respect to phenotype association was the difficulty to interpret the effects of RT variants.  Sucesses have been made regarding this question in the decades since the discovery of RTs. Importantly, \textit{in vitro} studies have established a host of effects that RTs can have on genes such as reduced expression or altering splicing signals. Moreover, \textit{in silico} studies have identified a subset of genome-wide trends that indicate potential functional implications of RT insertions such as being more deleterious near exons. Despite these advances, it remains difficult to interpret the effects of RT variants on the genome. This difficulty largely stems from multitude of effects that a RT can have on a genomic region. RTs contain many structural features ranging purley from the size of the insertion, to the AT-content, to specific protein binding motifs contained within the sequence. All of these features will disrupt the genome in varying ways depending largely on the genomic environment in which they insert. It was this ambiquity of the effect of RTs, that this study attempted to resolve.

Since the difficulty in predicting effects of RTs stems from the interaction between the RT element and the genomic context, it was important to examine the roles of both of these factors on the effect of RTs on genes. The definition of the measured effect of a RT on a gene was a challenge met in this project. There are many possible ways to measure the effect of RTs on genes. For example \textit{in vitro} studies could be performed where tagged RTs would be inserted into the host genome and measurements of chromatin changes, gene expression changes, and even methylation changes could be analyzed. The advantages of a study such as this would be that the effects of RTs would be studied in a relatively controlled environment, therefore the direct effects of RTs could be determined. Indeed many experiments such as these have proven the effects of L1 insertions on reduced transcriptional processivity of RNA Polymerase-II.  The disadvantages of studies such as this would be that the effects on the cell would be taken out of context of the organsism as a whole. It is important to retain the context of the organism for disease studies. Moreover, the intention of this project is to determine common trends of the effects of RTs on genes, and therefore it is important to study the effects of RTs on many genes and in many contexts. This kind of analysis would be infeasible using current \text{in silico} techniques.

Therefore, in order to study genome-wide trends of the effects of RTs on genes, two outputs were selected as measures in these experiments. The first output i.) was the force of selection on a RT and the second output ii.) was the phenotypic change of gene expression. These two types of measurements resulted in an ability to distinguish the strength of an effect of a RT over long periods of evolution, as well as a phenotypic change to validate the assumptions made by the initial findings. Together these studies both resulted in findings suggesting that RTs are not only capable of altering genes in a phenotypically selectable manner, but that many RTs are presently variable in the current human population that are associated with these changes.

\section{Selection Acts on Retrotransposons within Genes}
The initial finding that RT distribution was changing over time was supported by the first finding presented in this study, that newly integrated RTs are present in equal proportions in the sense and antisense orientations. This finding is important for the currently expanding field of RT research. Through the advances in sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, this field is quickly expanding with increasing numbers of papers being published on new annotations of RT insertions. A caveat of interpretting these new publications, is that the validation procedures for RT variant locations have been slower to advance than the annotation software. Therefore, it is highly likely that many of the new RT variants being published are false positives. Although validation procedures will surely catch up to the annotation procedures with time, there is currently a gap that results in a difficulty in interpreting these findings. Our research showing that RTs insert with equal proportions in the sense and antisense orientation can therefore be used as a quality control measure for these studies. I suggest that new studies should measure the AS bias of their sample and compare this measure to both the AS bias of newly inserted elements, and that of older elements. If the AS bias of a study is more closely aligned to that of older elements, then the attempts at validating these new insertions should be more stringent.  

The research presented in Chapter 2 identified that, when within genes, RTs often undergo purifying selection. This was the first time that evidence had been provided for purifying selection of RTs within genes. Previously, researchers had alluded to advantageous roles of RTs as the reason for their accumulation within genes. This concept of RTs as common mediators of advantageous changes is seductive in that it offers a path to study the conclusive function of RTs in the genome. As RTs are numbered in the effects that they have on the genome, it can be alluring to want to identify singular roles of their effect. Here, however, we identified that RTs are more likely to be deleterious within genes, than advantageous. Although this is a less entertaining scenario, it is a far more plausible hypothesis. It is often stated that loss-of-function mutations are far more likely to occur than gain-of-function mutations. This rule should hold true for RTs insertions as it does for any other form of genetic mutation.

Contrary to what I had initially hypothesized before embarking on this study, the two RTs studied here, Alu and L1, showed very different trends of selection. Regarding antisense bias (AS bias), both Alu and L1 intially had no AS bias. This then quickly changed to an increase of AS Alu and L1 over S Alu and L1. For Alu AS bias remained relatively constant across elements that had been inserted relatively early in primate evolution. Conversely, AS bias of L1 continued to increase with increasing residence times in the population. There are a few possible explanations for this observed difference in trends. One possibility is that the differences in times scales between L1 and Alu modify what is able to be observed in this analysis. L1 have been present since the evolution of early mammals and therefore small changes would have had more time to accumulate to a large enough effect when compared to Alu that have only been present since the split of primates. The slight, but not significant, upward trend observed in Alu may be an indication that small changes are occuring over time. Another, and not mutually exclusive, possibility for the differences in Alu and L1 are the strength of the effect that each element has on a gene. This leads to a hypothesis of a bimodal distribution of selection coefficients of RTs within genes. Perhaps there are a subset of RT insertions that have a large selection coefficient, for example a full-length L1 inserted in the sense orientation within a highly conserved coding exon. It would be expected that this type of RT would have a large selection coefficient. On the other hand, there may be inserts with smaller selection coeffecients, such as Alu in the antisense orientation in large intronic regions. A situation with these two insertions would likely result in the RT with the larger coefficient being selected against relatively quickly after integration. Converesely, the RT with the smaller coefficient would remain for longer periods of time, and perhaps reach fixation. This is what I believe is happening for Alu, two main types of insertions. i.) those that have a strong deleterious effect on the gene by inserting into coding regions, and ii.) those with minimal effects that are selected on very low levels. Converesely I believe that there is a third level of selection for L1. As RNA Polymerase II transcribed elements, L1 have a higher likelihood of distrupting gene function than Alu do. I therefore think that there are a third subset of L1 that are not deleterious enough to be selected against soon after integration, but which have a large enough selection coefficient to result in changing distribution over longer periods of evolutionary time.

Although this may seem like a small matter, it has large implications for the study of RT variants. First, if L1 are indeed capable of having a larger effect on genes, then they are more likely than Alu to be mediators of human disease. This is evidenced by the first associations of RTs with disease coming from L1 as opposed to Alu. Secondly if Alu are more likely to have smaller initial effects on the gene, then they are also more likely to be passed to the next generation. This gives Alu a higher chance of being co-opted by the system to serve a function since the Alu elements would have longer residence times. 

It must also be noted that we did not examine the effects of genetic drift on RT distribution. Genetic drift and population bottlenecks could lead to local alterations in the distributions of RTs. The reason that this was not accounted for this this study was because local effects of genetic drift would not be able to distinguish the orientation of an element. Therefore the observed bias of antisense and sense RTs is not likely to be an effect of genetic drift, and this was the variable that we studied to determine if RT distribution was due to selection.

\section{Variables Associated with Retrotransposon Distribution}
Previously it was thought that retrotransposons are increased near genes because they were conferring some sort of selective advantage to the gene. The research presented here shows the opposite. Our results showed that, as had been seen in previous studies, there was an increase of retrotransposons near the 5\rq -UTR. Interestigly, though, when we normalized genes by length, the RTs in the bin containing the transcription start site was reduced compared to what would be expected based on the trend across the rest of the deciles. Since the first decile was enriched for exons compared to the internal deciles, this dip in RT density indicated that RT density may be influenced by exon density, even near the 5\rq -UTR. Indeed, when this concept was followed up on, it was identified that not only are RTs reduced near coding exons, as has been previously shown, but when in the sense orientation they are also reduced near the 5\rq- UTR. This was a very unexpected finding since, as mentioned earlier, RTs are increased near the 5\rq region of a gene. The explanation that allows for the previous results and our results is that there is a lower coding sequence density near the 5\rq -region of a gene. This decrease in coding density results in a reciprocal increase in RT density that looks as though it is related to the 5\rq -UTR, but is rather due to the lack of CDS. Along with the results from the selection aim, this further supports that RTs are likely under purifying selection within genes, as opposed to serving common advantageous functions. 

It must be noted that we did not examine the evidence of selection for variables other than the AS bias. It is possible that AS bias is due to selection while the other biases (ie: tissue-specific patterns of distribution and binding motif preference) were due to integration rather than selection. Regarding the binding motifs, this is possible, though highly unlikely since the process of retrotransposition does not involve the internal binding motifs. Regarding tissue-specificity the possibility of integration bias is a bit more palpable. Since retrotransposition is influenced by chromatin dynamics, the structure of chromatin in the germ cell, specifically in the male germ cells, may play a role in bias of the number of insertions in different regions.

\section{output ii: gene expression}
Results from the selection analyses indicated that RTs had a phenotypic effect on organisms that was selected on throughout primate evolution. It was therefore important to see if any effects could be observed within genes that contained RTs. In order to study this groups of genes were identified that had polymorphic RTs, either between species, or between individuals. Gene expression was an optimal variable to study for this analysis since expression values were publically available for multiple primate species as well as many human individuals who had been typed for RT allele status.

The main results of these analyses showed that the presence of a RT, and more specifically an Alu, was associated with a decrease in gene expression. Interestingly, though, this was not true of all genes, indicating that there were other variables that were not being taken into account that effect the statistical interaction of RTs and gene expression. Again, this harkens back to the analyses in chapter 2 that showed that the effect of RTs is largely contingent upon the context in which they insert. For example, the orientation with repsect to the gene, the proximity to a 5\rq -UTR, the proximity to a coding sequence, and the and the gene type in which they insert were all modifiers of the distribution of RTs within genes. It is therefore likely that these variables can also be modifiers of gene expression. Unfourtunately there was not a large enough sample size of elements that also had expression values to calculate the effect of these variables on gene expression. In the future, when more data on RT polymorphisms becomes available, associations between these subtle variations and gene expression should be further explored. 
 
Most of the significant associations between RT and gene expression came from Alu as opposed to L1 or SVA. It is possible that Alu, L1, and SVA all have effects on gene expression, but that they are only observed in Alu in this analysis due to selective pressures and sample size issues. For example, we saw in the section on selection that L1 seem to have a higher selective coefficient than Alu. If L1 have a larger effect on gene expression than Alu, then perhaps they do not survive in the population, and therefore they were not observed in this analysis. Converesely, and consistent with the hypothesis presented earlier, perhaps Alu have a smaller, but present, impact on gene expression. Therefore they are passed on through the population due to a low selective coefficient, and we can observe the effect when present. Regarding SVA, it is possible that these elements have an effect on genes that was not detected since SVA occur at much lower levels in the genome than the other elements. This reduction in sample size reduces the power to detect any significant results with small effect sizes. 

Perhaps the most intriguing finding regarding gene expression was that the decrease in expression was associated with RTs in a sex-specific manner. The interesting thing about this finding was that gene expression seemed to be reduced in males and remained relatively unaffected in females. The finding that there is a difference in the effect of the RT on gene expression based on sex indicated that there may be sex-specific binding elements within the RT that are effecting transcription. RTs are known to contain hormone response elements within their consensus sequences, which could be the mediators of this response. Interestingly, these hormone response elements respond largely to estrogen, a hormone important for female development. It is possible that the straightforward hypothesis for the interaction between Alu and gene expression is due to a male-specific binding region within Alu that repressed expression of the coincident gene. However, another hypothesis is also possible. Since it has been shown that long stretches of adensosines reduces transcription, it is likely that an insertion of Alu would decrease expression in both males and females. Perhaps expression is decreased in both males and females in the presence of an Alu, however, in females estrogen binding elements play a role in opening up the region for higher expression, thereby negating the initial effect of the insertiong.

Whether either of these hypotheses are true, the results still stand that there are signs of sex-specific differences in expression contingent on the polymorphism status of Alu retrotransposons. Future studies should examine the role of Alu in mediating sex-specific roles of development. Studies should also examine the hormone binding sites with Alu elements, and their potential for effeting changes in cell behavior. The known sex-specific factors that are contained within Alu are the RORA-1 response elements and the DR-2 elements, though there is the potential that there are other binding motifs or sex-specific effects of Alu that are currently unknown.

\section{The potential link between Alu and Autism Spectrum Disorder}

In the analyses of altered gene expression in association with retrotransposon polymorphisms, we found that there was a significant overlap between genes that were differentially expressed, and genes that serve a brain specific function. Even more interesting was the finding that these genes were signficantly enriched for genes that have been previously associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A somewhat boring explanation for this could be that brain genes are larger on average than most genes, therefore it is more likely that a RT would insert within these genes than within any other gene. One level above that would be that genes which are expressed in the brain are also expressed in the testis (GERM CELL THOUGH?). In order for a mutation to be passed down to the next generation it would have to occur in the germ line. Therefore if there is a chromatin bias to the insertion mechanism, then perhaps there is an increased likelihood for inserting into testis genes, and therefore brain genes. THe problem with this hypothesis is that testis genes are not enriched in the gene set that we have looked in. So this in not likely the answer.

However you look at it, though, there is an increase of RTs in brain genes. There is no thought that is is due to some guided pre-meditated force directing integration. HOWever, once the insertions are there, perhaps they co-opt some sort of function. 


Interestingly RORA-1 has been linked to Autism [more info]

\section{Future goals}
In the near future I would like to use this knowledge to create predictions of RT frequency in the human genome for every known RT. I think it would be possible to create a value for each RT that represents the likelihood that that retrotransposon should exist given the trends based on genomic averages. If a RT has a really low score, but exists in the human genome, perhaps that RT has an effect on the genome that should be tested, or at least catalouged so when variants arise in the gene it can be noted for disease studies.
