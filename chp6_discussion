\chapter{Discussion}
\section{Overall Conclusions}
The goal of most human genomics studies today is to attribute genetic variation to disease phenotypes. These variations commonly take the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), small insertions/deletions (indels), and large copy number variations (CNVs). Genome-wide studies attempting to associate genetic variation with phenotypes have been successful at identifying much of the heritable component of many genes. For example [PUT EXAMPLES HERE, LOOK AT SOME REVIEWS]. Despite the success of these association studies, there is still a large amount of heritability of diseases that is unaccounted for.

The reasons that there is still heritability unaccounted for probably lies in many factors. For example, if many variants in different genes work together to create a disease phenotype, it would be difficult to pick up all of the small effects, especially with the small sample sizes often used in studies today. Another reason for missing heritability is the possibility that the genetic variant that is causing the disease is not being considered for analysis. This is often discussed in the literature with respect to SNP filtering, where SNPs in intergenic regions, or SNPs that do not fall below a certain threshold of allele frequency are not considered for functional analysis. Although these SNPs may be effecting the disease phenotype, they are not considered for analysis. Another, and arguably more detrimental, oversight is the lack of analysis of retrotransposon (RTs) variants.

\section{Selection}
Evidence of natural selection is often used as a measure of the functionality of a region, or of it's usefulness to an organism. For example, there is a database of the conservation of each nucleotide in the human genome that is used to calculate the likelihood that the specific nucleotide is useful. The idea is that the more conserved a nucleotide, or region is, the more likely it is to do something useful, or to lead to disease when disrupted. Evidence of selection has therefore been used to determine the likelihood that RTs are effecting genes in some functional way. 

---> Alu can be co-opted as useful sequence since they don't have any large detrimental effects on the system (unlike L1). This would allow them to be maintained in the genome under neutral-esque conditions.

--> Present the proposed two-step model of selection (draw a figure for this). Where step one is the immediate selection (both Alu and L1), and step two is the slow selection (L1 only)

---> Talk about how AS L1 were sometimes older than intergenic L1 (even when first separated by subfamily). Talk about how sense L1 on chrY were much younger than expected, and talk about how L1 is though to play an active role in X-inactivation. Talk about the potential of using the older L1 as a prediction tool to identify functional roles of L1.

--> Look at the discussion from this paper for talking about expectations of ChrX versus autosomes (Estimate of the Mutation Rate per Nucleotide in Humans)

\section{Effect on Phenotype}
--> Talk about variability between humans and missing heritability and how RTs can be responsible for some of this missing heritability

--> OTX2 and PITX2 are both involved in neuronal stuff...They are present in all the Alu consensus sequences

\section{Sex Specific Effects}

---> Talk about retinoic acid response elements within Alu and how that might be contributing to the difference in expression between the sexes (especially RORA1)

\section {Neuropsychiatric Disorders}

---> Autisim and Schizophrenia (Epilepsy?)

---> hnRNP C and Schizophrenia (Altering the expression balance of hnRNP C1 and C2 changes the expression of myelination-related genes)
\subsection{Title}

\section{Future of Retrotransposons in Human Genetics Research}
---> Talk about the use of RTs in GWAS type studies.


---> Talk about somatic retrotransposition and how that can lead to variation within a human

--> How future research should take what's known from chp3 and make a prediction algorithm for de novo inserts. Also the same algorithm should be used for reference RTs, and the ones that fall outside of what they would be predicted should be evalutated for function
