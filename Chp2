\chapter{\\ORIGINS OF THE RETROTRANSPOSON ANTISENSE BIAS}
\doublespace\large{

The phenomenon of non-randomly distributed RTs facilitates studies into the variable effects that RTs impart on genes. Effects that may be accompanied by phenotypic changes. This is only true, however, if the altered distribution of RTs within genes is due to forces acting on phenotypes (i.e.: selection) as opposed to other mechanisms such as genetic drift or RT mobilization. Studies attempting to determine the mechanistic underpinnings leading to changes in RT distribution over time have identified that selection is indeed the major mechanism responsible [REFs, and \ref{sec:dist}].

Despite the knowledge that some form of selection acts on RTs in general, there are two major questions that are yet to be resolved, i) is the altered distribution of RTs, specifically within genes, due to selection? and ii) are the selective forces acting on RTs positive or negative (purifying)? Although the first question (i) may seem like an unnecessary detail to pursue, it is vital to future studies attempting to discern the phenotypic effects of RTs on genes. It is important because there are altered distributions of RTs within genes that, if they are due to selection, can be used to predict the phenotypic impact of future insertions. If instead the altered distribution of RTs in genes is due to integration, then these predictions would be unfounded, and perhaps misleading. Though it is unlikely, it is possible that the altered distributions within genes are due to integration bias. This distinction must be determined before further analyses on phenotypic associations with RTs distributions are analyzed.

The RT antisense bias (AS bias) is a powerful example of altered distributions of RTs within genes that can be used to delineate between effects of selection versus integration. AS bias is the tendency of RTs to be present in the antisense (AS) orientation within genes more often than the sense (S) orientation. An interesting feature of AS bias is that it peaks near transcription start sites (TSS), as do the total number of RTs \cite{Medstrand2002}.

This recurring altered distribution of AS bias towards transcription start sites may indicate an mechanism of selection, however it may also indicate a preference for integration locations. An argument for the enrichment of  RTs  near the TSS is that there is increased open chromatin near the TSS and therefore increased accesibility to the L1 ORF2p endonuclease [REF]. However, if open chromatin was the reason for the increase in RTs then this preference should be replicated in both the sense and antisense orientations. Moreover, since L1 ORF2p endonucleases bind dsDNA, there should be no preference for integration due to single-strand accesibility [REF]. Also, it has been shown that RTs in the sense orientation effect transcription of the coincident gene, while RTs in the antisense orientation have little to no effect [REFs]. For these reasons, it was hypothesized that the AS bias of RTs in genes was due to selection.   

To distinguish whether AS bias was truly a result of    selection over time or if it was due to integration, the distribution of relatively recent Alu insertions were examined, as well as the change in AS bias over evolutionary time.

\section{Retrotransposon Antisense Bias and the Process of Integration}
\subsection{Young AS and S Alu are Present in Equal Proportions}
Newly inserted RTs should be equally represented in the sense (S) and antisense (AS) orientations if selection is the driving force of AS bias in genes. Alu insert at a higher rate than either L1 or SVA, and therefore have a larger sample size of elements with low residence times in the population (i.e.: young Alu). For this reason, Alu were studied to examine the AS bias of newly inserted elements. 

Two samples of young Alu were used for this analysis (\textit{a} and \textit{b}) filtered groups of Alu that were annotated as insertions in the \num{1000} genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}, and (\textit{c}) Alu annotated as newly identified germline insertions \cite{Baillie2011, Bundo2013}. Both groups represent Alu that are polymorphic with relatively small residence times in the population. Here, polymorphic refers to presence or absence of the entire Alu element where any mutations within the element are irrelevant. 

Alu in groups \textit{a} and \textit{b} were initially identified in the 1000 genomes project as being polymorphic between individuals \cite{Stewart2011}. The allele frequencies of these elements were calculated from three populations; Yoruban (YRI); European (CEU); and Chinese/Japanese (CHBJPT) \cite{Stewart2011}. For the current analysis, 1000 genomes annoted Alu were separated into two groups: \textit{a}) population-specific Alu (i.e.: Allele Frequency (AF) > 0 in only one population), and \textit{b}) Alu present among two or more populations. Group \textit{c} elements were derived from three individuals that were examined for non-reference Alu insertions in various somatic tissues. The mean AFs of group \textit{a} Alu were 0.091 ($\pm$0.071), 0.067 ($\pm$0.047), and 0.070 ($\pm$0.067) in YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT respectively. To identify the mean AF of group \textit{b} Alu, the maximum population-specific AF was identified per element. The average of these maximum AFs was significantly higher than the population-specific sets 0.587($\pm$0.30) (Wilcoxon rank sum p$_{, YRI}$ < 1.3e-184; p$_{, CEU}$ < 2.6e-62; p$_{, CHBJPT}$ < 8.5e-49). Since AFs are correlated with residence times in the population [REF], these AFs indicate that group \textit{a} Alu have shorter residence times (younger) than group \textit{b}.

Alu counts from YRI, CEU, CHBJPT, and group \textit{c} were combined to reduce type II error by increasing sample size. The insertions that were deemed 'germline' insertions by comparison between multiple tissues were used for this analysis.

The proportion of AS elements in the young group of Alu were compared versus the antisense bias of reference Alu. The reference set was chosen as the comparison since this was the group of Alu from within which the AS bias was originally identified. As has been previously documented, the proportions of AS and S Alu in the Hg19 reference was significantly different from the null hypothesis of equal distribution (probability of AS = 0.55 ; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.548} - \num{0.550}; p < \num{2.47}e-\num{323}). A test of equal proportions was used to calculate the deviation from the null hypothesis that young AS Alu occur in equal proportion to that of reference Alu. It was identified that reference Alu had a significantly different AS bias than newly inserted Alu ($propAS_{\text{young}}$ = 0.48; $propAS_{\text{Ref}}$ = 0.55; \num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.08} - \num{-0.06}; p < \num{6.18}e-28). This  shows that the AS bias present in reference Alu is not present upon integration. 

%TPRT
\subsection{AS bias is present in transposons integrated by non-TPRT mechanisms}

The overarching goal of this chapter was to discriminate between the RT integration process and selection over time, as being responsible for AS bias. It has just been shown that there is no discernable AS bias upon integration, indiciating that the process of Alu integration (ie: TPRT) does not likely contribute to AS bias. Alu, L1, and SVA are all integrated through the process of TPRT, and all have significant differences in the proportion of AS and S elements. Therefore, it is pertinent to this study to determine if AS bias is restricted to elements which are integrated by TPRT. The null hypothesis that transposons inserted by non-TPRT mechanisms had equal proportions of sense and antisense elements was examined. Similar to Alu, a pooled group of DNA transposons had a significant increase of AS elements over S elements (probability of AS = \num{0.540}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.538} - \num{0.543}; p < \num{1.64}e\num{-190}), indicating that AS bias is not restricted to the RT-specific form of integration, TPRT.

%AS bias changes over evolutionary time
\section{Antisense Bias Increases Over Evolutionary Time}
[Write a mini intro here]

\subsection{Antisense bias of Alu is Constant across Reference Subfamilies}
Since Alu present in the reference genome have a significantly larger proportion of AS elements than newly integrated elements, it is likely that this change in proportion was due to a progressive action over time. It is important to examine the change in AS bias over time, since a change over time is indicative of selection acting on the elements depending on the orientation within a gene. The fact that RTs can have a selectable effect on genes depending on their orientation would then allow us to study the effects that RTs are having on genes. 
    
To examine the change of pAS over time Alu and L1 were grouped by their predefined subfamilies. Elements within a subfamily have similar residence times in the genome [REFs]. The relative age of a subfamily is often measured as the average distance of all elements within a subfamily from the respective consensus sequence (milliDiv). Millidiv was therefore used as a measurement of time where smaller values of millidiv corresponded to younger elements with less residence time in the population, and larger millidiv corresponded to older elements with longer residence times. AS bias was compared across between Alu of the same subfamily (figure \ref{fig:pAS_subfam}. There was a slight increase in AS bias with increasing millidiv, though, this increase was not signficant (slope: 4.1e-04; F-test p = \num{0.38}).

        \label{fig:pAS_subfam}
    \end{figure}
    
 
\subsection{Antisense bias of Alu increases quickly over evolutionary time}
Since AS bias in reference Alu was independent of the residence time in the population, I was led to examine the hypothesis that AS bias in Alu is achieved rapidly after integration and is then left unchanged after the element has become fixed in the population. To examine the change of AS proportion on shorter time scales than the previous analysis, the proportion of AS of young Alu were compared to Alu that were shared among all three populations (group c). Shared Alu are assumed to have longer residence times in the genome than young Alu because shared elements must have integrated prior to the split of YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT, while young elements are assumed to have inserted after the split. The higher average allele frequencies of shared Alu compared to group population-specific Alu substantiates this assumption ($AF_{\text{YRI}}$ = 0.09 ; $AF_{\text{CEU}}$ = 0.07 ; $AF_{\text{CHBJPT}}$ = 0.07 ; $AF_{\text{shared}}$ =  0.24. Although the shared Alu had a mean frequency of 0.24, there were elements with allele frequencies of 1 within a specific population (figure \ref{fig:shared_freq}). The proportion of AS in the young subset of Alu was significantly smaller than polymorphic Alu that were shared among all three populations ($propAS_{\text{young}}$ = 0.48; $propAS_{\text{shared}}$ = 0.54; \num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.11} - \num{-0.02}; p < \num{0.01}). This indicates that the change to AS bias of Alu occured quickly over evolutionary time.

The count of Alu is plotted as a function of the maximum allele frequency between YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT.}
        \label{fig:shared_freq}
    \end{figure}


These results indicate that Alu are initially integrated with no AS bias, AS and S Alu are then differentially maintained setting up the reference AS bias. And this event occurs relatively quickly on evolutionary time scales (ie: prior to fixation).

\subsection{Antisense bias of L1 Increases Across Reference Subfamilies}
L1 are present in high enough numbers in the reference genome to be analyzed for AS bias across subfamilies. The combined Hg19 reference L1 AS bias is significantly different from 0.50 (probability of AS = \num{0.656}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.654} - \num{0.657}; p < \num{1.98}e{-323}). The AS bias of L1 is larger than that of Alu. Furthermore, contrary to the results from Alu, L1 exhibit a significant association between AS bias and relative age as measured by millidiv (F-test p < \num{2.66}e{-06}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_l1_2}).

%Signs of purifying selection
\section{Differences in Selection Between S and AS Alu and L1}
The results so far have shown that AS bias increases over time, with Alu increasing relatively quickly and L1 continuing to increase over larger periods of time. If selection within genes is playing a role in this change in AS bias, there are three likely explanations. 1.) Antisense RTs undergo positive selection within genes, 2.) Sense RTs undergo negative (purifying) selection within genes, 3.) Both (1) and (2) are true. Previous reports have indicated that on a genome-wide level, Alu undergo purifying selection \cite{Stewart2011}, though [REF] has proposed that RTs are under positive selection within genes.

In 1975 Li calculated that on average, deleterious alleles have shorter residence times in a population. In other words, they will be younger than neutral or advantageous alleles \cite{Li1975}. The logic behind this finding lies in that, in populations of equal size, an allele is more likely to be passed on to the next generation if it is neutral or positive compared to an allele that is deleterious. The neutral or positive allele will therefore remain in the population longer, accumulating a longer residence time in the genome. Meanwhile, new alleles, both advantageous and deleterious will continually appear. While the advantageous alleles are retained, the deleterious alleles will continually be lost, with only young alleles that have replaced them remaining present. Therefore at any discrete point in time, the deleterious alleles will be younger on average than the advantageous or neutral alleles.

\subsection{Purifying selection of RTs in genes}
Using the rationale presented in Li, 1975; the relative force of selection can be compared between two, otherwise equal, alleles by calculating their respective residence times in a population. RTs within a subfamily are defined by the fact that they amplified at similar points in time [REF]. Therefore, with similar forces, or durations of selection, the mean ages of AS and S RTs of the same subfamily should be equivalent.

To examine the differences in age between AS and S RTs, regions with differences in AS bias were identified. The was being that in regions with a large discrepancy between AS and S proportions, there would also be a large discrepancy between AS and S age distributions. To determine the regions of differences in AS bias, genes were divided into deciles by normalizing by gene length. AS and S RTs were counted in each decile and normalized by the total RT count within genes. The results of this analysis are detailed in Chapter 3 section \ref{sec:as_dec}. The regions with the most apparent change in AS bias were near the 5\rq end (2nd decile) and near the 3\ end (9th decile) (figure \ref{fig:selection5_3.png}). Furthermore there was a linear decay of AS bias across both Alu and L1 (figures \ref{lineardecay_alu} and \ref{lineardecay_l1}). This pattern of a linear change in AS bias across gene deciles was a prime oppurtunity to examine the association of age with AS bias. Since Alu and L1 showed different changes in AS bias over time, it was expected that the age ranges associated with differences in AS bias would also be different. It was expected that despite the apparent AS bias, Alu would have relatively similar ages between AS and S elements, since they likely were selected on relatively soon after integration. Conversely, is was expected that AS L1 would be older than S elements near the 5\rq end of genes, since the AS bias changed over long periods of time for L1. It was also expected that AS L1 would be similar in age to S elements near the 3\rq end since the AS bias is not significant near the 3\rq end of genes.
