    \paragraph{\large\textbf{Purpose: \\}}
    \large{The distribution of retrotransposons throughout the human genome shifted towards a non-uniform pattern over evolutionary time \cite{Lander2001,Moyzis1989, Ovchinnikov2001}. As mentioned previously, L1 elements are enriched within GC-poor regions, while Alu are commonly found in GC-rich regions \cite{Pavlicek2001, Soriano1983}. A second pattern of distribution emerges when analysis is restricted to gene regions. For example, previous studies have identified an increase of many families of retrotransposons near 5'\-UTRs \cite{Medstrand2002}.To distinguish whether this non-uniform distribution of retrotransposons within genes is a result of a bias during insertion, as opposed to an accumulation over time, we calculated the distribution of relatively recent Alu insertions within genes.
