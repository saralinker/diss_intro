\chapter{\\ORIGINS OF THE RETROTRANSPOSON ANTISENSE BIAS}
The non-random distribution of RTs can be used to facilitate studies into the variable effects that RTs impart on genes; effects that may be accompanied by phenotypic changes. The distribution of RTs is only useful in these studies, however, if it is due to forces acting on phenotypes (i.e.: selection) as opposed to non-phenotype associated mechanisms such as integration preferences. Studies attempting to determine the mechanistic underpinnings leading to changes in RT distribution over time have identified that selection plays a role in the genome-wide distribution of RTs (section \ref{sec:dist}), but it is unknown if the altered distribution observed within genes is also due to forces of selection.

Despite the knowledge that selection acts on RTs in general, there are two major questions that are yet to be resolved, i) is the altered distribution of RTs, specifically within genes, due to selection and ii) are the selective forces acting on RTs positive or negative (purifying). Although the first question (i) may seem like an minor detail to pursue, it is vital to future studies attempting to discern the phenotypic effects of RTs on genes. It is important because there are altered distributions of RTs within genes that, if they are due to selection, can be used to predict the phenotypic impact of future insertions. This knowledge would therefore inform future disease studies investigating the association between RTs and phenotype. If instead the altered distribution of RTs in genes is due to the non phenotype-dependent force of integration then these predictions would be unfounded, and perhaps misleading. Therefore, before further analyses on phenotypic associations with RTs distributions are analyzed, it must be determined whether RT integration is the force driving altered distribution of RTs within genes, or if forces associated with phenotype (i.e.: selection) are the driving force.

The RT antisense bias (AS bias) is a powerful example of altered distributions of RTs within genes that can be used to delineate between effects of selection versus integration. AS bias is the tendency of RTs to be present in the antisense (AS) orientation within genes more often than the sense (S) orientation. An interesting feature of AS bias is that it peaks near transcription start sites (TSS), as do the total number of RTs \cite{Medstrand2002}.

This recurring altered distribution of AS bias towards transcription start sites may indicate an mechanism of selection, however it may also indicate a preference for integration locations. An argument for the enrichment of  RTs  near the TSS is that there is increased open chromatin near the TSS and therefore increased accesibility to the L1 ORF2p endonuclease. However, if open chromatin was the reason for the increase in RTs then this preference should be replicated in both the sense and antisense orientations. Moreover, since L1 ORF2p endonucleases cleaves dsDNA \cite{Feng1996}, there should be no preference for integration due to single-strand accesibility. Also, it has been shown that L1 in the S orientation decrease expression of a coincident gene, however the same effect is not true of L1 in the AS orientation \cite{Han2004}. For these reasons, it was hypothesized that the AS bias of RTs in genes was due to a selective process.   

To distinguish whether AS bias was truly a result of selection over time or if it was due to integration, the distribution of relatively recent Alu insertions were examined, as well as the change in AS bias over evolutionary time.

\section{Retrotransposon Antisense Bias and the Process of Integration}

Under the hypothesis that selection is the driving force of AS bias in genes, the difference in AS and S elements should accumulate over time, and newly inserted RTs should have no observable bias. Relatively young Alu and L1 were therefore studied to examine the AS bias of newly inserted elements. Three groups of young RTs (Alu and L1) were used for this analysis. Groups \textit{a} and \textit{b} were filtered groups of Alu and L1 that were annotated as insertions in the \num{1000} genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}. Group \textit{c} Alu and L1 were annotated as newly identified germline insertions \cite{Baillie2011, Bundo2013}. All three groups represented RTs that were polymorphic with relatively small residence times in the population (young). Here, polymorphic refers to the status of presence or absence of the entire element where any mutations within the element were irrelevant to the status.

\subsection{Allele Frequencies of Polymorphic Alu Used in This Analysis}
\label{sec:af}
Since the goal was to determine if either the immediate force of integration or the longitudinal force of selection was responsible for AS bias, elements were grouped based on residence of time in the population. Population allele frequency was used as a proxy for residence time. Alu in groups \textit{a} and \textit{b} were initially identified in the 1000 genomes project as being polymorphic between individuals \cite{Stewart2011}. The allele frequencies of these elements were calculated from three populations; Yoruban (YRI); European (CEU); and Chinese/Japanese (CHBJPT) \cite{Stewart2011}. For the current analysis, 1000 genomes annoted Alu were separated into the two groups mentioned above: \textit{a}) population-specific Alu (i.e.: Allele Frequency (AF) > 0 in only one population), and \textit{b}) Alu present among all three populations. The expecatation was that elements present in only one population were more likley to have small residence times (\textit{a}). Similarly elements present prior to the split of the three populations would be present in all three populations and would likely have longer residence times (\textit{b}). The mean AFs of group \textit{a} Alu were 0.091 ($\pm$0.071), 0.067 ($\pm$0.047), and 0.070 ($\pm$0.067) in YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT respectively. To identify the mean AF of group \textit{b} Alu, the maximum population-specific AF was identified per element. The average of these maximum AFs was significantly higher than the population-specific sets 0.279 ($\pm$0.16) (Wilcoxon rank sum p$_{, YRI}$ < 1.3e-184; p$_{, CEU}$ < 2.6e-62; p$_{, CHBJPT}$ < 8.5e-49). The AFs of group \textit{c} Alu were similar in all three populations (figure \ref{fig:AF_3d}). Since AFs are correlated with residence times in the population \cite{Li1975}, these AFs indicate that group \textit{a} Alu have shorter residence times (younger) than group \textit{b}.

\subsection{Young AS and S Alu are Present in Equal Proportions}
\label{sec:youngas}
Although the allele frequencies of group \textit{c} RTs were unknown, they were identified in Baillie et. al. as being present in the germline insertions. Since group \textit{a} and \textit{c} RTs all represent young polymorphic insertions the counts were combined across all groups to reduce type II error by increasing sample size (table \ref{table:youngasbias}). The probability of choosing an AS RT in this combined group was tested versus an expected probability of 0.50 using the binomial sign test. The hypothesis that young insertions had an AS bias equal to 0.50 could not be rejected (p(AS) = 0.50 ; \num{95}\% CI = 0.47 -- 0.53; p = 0.84). It was noted, that there may have been a bias imparted to the calculation by combining both group \text{a} and \textit{c} RTs. Group \textit{a} RTs were therefore tested separately, despite a reduction in power, and also  did not have a p(AS) significantly different from 0.5 (p(AS) = 0.53; \num{95}\% CI = 0.48 -- 0.57; p = 0.20). Although the results of insignificance indicated that young RTs may not have an AS bias, the null hypothesis can not be proved, only rejected \cite{Popper1959,Wilckinson2013}. Therefore, young RTs were tested against the AS bias of the reference RTs, to determine if the AS bias of young elements was significantly different from the bias that is often cited in the literature \cite{Zhang2011}.

The proportion of AS elements in the young group of Alu and L1 were compared versus the AS bias of reference Alu and L1. As has been previously documented, the proportions of AS and S Alu and L1 in the Hg19 reference were significantly different from the null hypothesis of equal distribution (table \ref{table:alul1ref}). A test of equal proportions was used to calculate the deviation from the null hypothesis that young AS RTs occur in equal proportion to that of reference RTs. It was identified that reference Alu and L1 RTs had a significantly different AS bias than newly inserted Alu (proportion AS$_{young}$ = 0.50; proportion AS$_{Ref}$ = 0.59; \num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.12} - \num{-0.057}; p < \num{4.44}e-09). This was further evidence that the commonly cited AS bias of reference Alu was not present initially upon integration.

%TPRT
\subsection{AS bias is present in transposons integrated by non-TPRT mechanisms}

The evidence presented in section \ref{sec:youngas} has shown that there is no discernible AS bias upon integration, indicating that the process of Alu integration (ie: TPRT) does not likely contribute to AS bias. Alu, L1, and SVA are all integrated through the process of TPRT, and all have significant differences in the proportion of AS and S elements (table \ref{table:alul1ref}). Therefore, it was pertinent to this study to determine if AS bias was restricted to elements which were integrated by TPRT. The null hypothesis that transposons inserted by non-TPRT mechanisms had equal proportions of S and AS elements was examined. Similar to the RTs Alu and L1, a pooled group of DNA transposons had a significant increase of AS elements over S elements (probability of AS = \num{0.540}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.538} - \num{0.543}; p < \num{1.64}e\num{-190}), indicating that AS bias is likely due to a process that acts independently of the mechanism of integration.

%AS bias changes over evolutionary time
\section{Antisense Bias Increases Over Evolutionary Time}
Since Alu present in the reference genome have a significantly larger proportion of AS elements than newly integrated elements, it is likely that this change in proportion was due to a progressive action over time. It was therefore important to examine the change in AS bias over time. To examine the change of p(AS) over time, AS bias of Alu and L1 were individually examined after separation into their predefined subfamilies. The relative age of a subfamily is often measured as the average distance of all elements within a subfamily from the respective consensus sequence (millidiv). Since elements within a subfamily inserted at similar points in evolutionary time, elements within a subfamily are expected to have similar values of millidiv. The average millidiv across all elements within a subfamily was therefore used as a measurement of time where smaller values of millidiv corresponded to younger subfamilies with less residence time in the population, and larger millidiv corresponded to older subfamilies with longer residence times.

        \label{fig:pAS_subfam}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsection{Antisense bias of Alu is Constant across Reference Subfamilies}
Since Alu originated in the primate lineage, the scale of Alu age spans from early primate evolution, to modern human evolution. AS bias was examined across Alu subfamilies ranked by millidiv (figure \ref{fig:pAS_subfam}). Although there was a slight increase in AS bias with increasing millidiv, this increase was not signficant (slope: 4.1e-04; F-test p = \num{0.38}). This indicated that the effect leading to AS bias of Alu likely occured soon after the time point of integration. 

\subsection{Antisense bias of L1 Increases Across Reference Subfamilies}

    %Figure pAS_subfamily L1
    \begin{figure}[!ht]

        \label{fig:pAS_l1_2}
    \end{figure}
    
Although Alu and L1 both have a signficant AS bias in the genome, it is possible that they are undergoing different degrees of selection. As pol-II promoted transcripts, L1 have the potential to disrupt expression more substantially than Alu. Furthermore, L1 have also been evolving since before the split of  marsupials and eutherians, as opposed to Alu which have only been present in the primate lineages, therefore the extent of time that is covered by the L1 subfamilies is effectively longer than that of Alu. For these reasons, it is more likely to observe a change in AS bias in L1 as opposed to Alu. This is evidenced by the finding that the AS bias of L1 overall is significantly larger than that of Alu (prop AS$_{L1}$ =  0.656; prop AS$_{Alu}$ = 0.549 ; p < 2.2e-16).

L1 AS bias was also examined across subfamilies ordered by millidiv. Contrary to the findings in Alu, there was a significant trend towards an increase in AS bias over time (F-test p < \num{2.66}e{-06}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_l1_2}). These results indicated that, in L1, AS bias increased dynamically over long periods of evolutionary time. 

 
\subsection{Antisense bias of Alu increases quickly over evolutionary time}
The findings so far have shown that AS and S RTs have no bias upon integration, however there is an AS bias of Alu in the reference genome. For Alu, this AS bias in reference Alu was independent of the age of the subfamily. It was therefore hypothesized that AS bias in Alu was achieved rapidly after integration.  To examine the change of AS proportion on shorter time scales than the previous analysis, p(AS) of young Alu were compared to p(AS) of Alu that were shared among all three populations (section \ref{sec:af}: group \textit{b}). As mentioned previously, shared Alu (group \textit{b}) were assumed to have longer residence times in the genome than young Alu because shared elements must have integrated prior to the split of YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT, while young elements were assumed to have inserted after the split. The higher average allele frequencies of shared Alu compared to group population-specific Alu substantiated this assumption (section \ref{sec:youngas}). The AS bias was compared between group \textit{b} and the combined group \textit{a} and \textit{c} to determine if AS bias was present in this slightly older group of elements. Indeed The proportion of AS in the young subset of Alu was significantly smaller than polymorphic Alu that were shared among all three populations ($propAS_{\text{young}}$ = 0.50; $propAS_{\text{shared}}$ = 0.54; \num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.11} - \num{-0.02}; p < \num{0.01}) [REDO THIS CALCULATION THE P=VALUE MIGHT BE OFF, TOO LAZY RIGHT NOW]. This indicated that the change to AS bias of Alu occured quickly over evolutionary time.

    %Figure pAS

        \label{fig:shared_freq}
    \end{figure}


Overall, these results indicated that Alu and L1 were initially integrated with no AS bias. The proportion of AS and S Alu changed relatively quickly over evolutionary time scales (ie: prior to fixation). The AS bias of L1 also changed over evolutionary time, and at much larger time scales than that of Alu.

%Signs of purifying selection
\section{Evidence of  Selection Acting on Alu and L1}
The results so far have shown that AS bias is not present upon integration but increases over time, as would be expected under a model of selection. If selection within genes is playing a role in this change in AS bias, there are three hypotheses that can be tested: \textit{1}) Antisense RTs undergo positive selection within genes, \textit{2}) Sense RTs undergo negative (purifying) selection within genes, and \textit{3}) Both (\textit{1}) and (\textit{2}) are true. Previous reports have indicated that Alu undergo purifying selection on a genome-wide level \cite{Stewart2011}. However, Lander et al. proposed that the increase of Alu in GC-rich regions was due to positive selection, though gave no experimental evidence to support these conclusions \cite{Lander2001}. Neither of these studies have addressed the selection of RTs within gene boundaries, which is important to study due to the potential distruptions of RTs directly on transcription as well as regulation of both transcription and translation \cite{Thornburg2006,Wang2009}.

In 1975 Li calculated that on average, deleterious alleles have shorter residence times in a population. In other words, they will be younger than neutral or advantageous alleles \cite{Li1975}. The logic behind this finding lies in that, in populations of equal size, an allele is more likely to be passed on to the next generation if it is neutral or positive compared to an allele that is deleterious. The neutral or positive allele will therefore remain in the population longer, accumulating a longer residence time in the genome. Meanwhile, new alleles, both advantageous and deleterious will continually appear. While the advantageous alleles are retained, the deleterious alleles will continually be lost, with only young alleles that have replaced them remaining present. Therefore at any discrete point in time, the deleterious alleles will be younger on average than the advantageous or neutral alleles.

         %Figure

    \end{figure}

Using the rationale presented in Li, 1975; the relative force of selection can be compared between two, otherwise equal, alleles by calculating their respective residence times in a population. RTs within a subfamily are an optimal sample to study selective forces, since they have the advantage of being amplified at similar points in time. Therefore, elements of the same subfamily should have similar residence times in the population when calculated as millidiv. However, if there are deviations in the forces of selection between subsets of the subfamily (i.e: AS versus S, or intergenic versus within genes) , then the residence times in the population should be unequal. An example of the hypothesis is presented in figure \ref{fig:l1age}. Here is shown the AS bias of Alu in two regions of genes, one region with a large AS bias, and one region with no AS bias. The hypotheses of selection underlying these distributions are listed at the bottom of the figure. 


\subsection{Evidence of Selection on L1 within Genes}

         %Figure 
    \begin{figure}[!ht]

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{l1_age_anova.pdf}

        More here
        }
        \label{fig:l1ageanova}
    \end{figure}

To study the potential of selection acting on RTs, it was important to determine if the age, in millidiv, of an L1 element was contingent on the placement within the genome (i.e.: intergenic, AS within genes, or S within genes). To examine the association of age with placement, millidiv was regressed on dummy variables representing each possible placement of the element (equation \ref{l1anova}).

Since each element was expected to have the respective subfamily contribute a larger effect to millidiv than the placement, the effect of subfamily needed to be taken into account in the model. For example, a currently active L1 would be expected to have a smaller millidiv value (i.e.: younger) than an L1 that was inserted before the split of primates (i.e.:older), whether or not the old L1 was under selection. There were multiple possible ways of normalizing for subfamily including, adding the subfamily in the model as a random effect, or adding the subfamily as an interaction term. It was decided, that for this analysis, the optimal method would be to calculate a separate regression equation for each subfamily [SURE THIS IS RIGHT?].  This method of analyzing the subfamilies separately was chosen instead of adding the subfamilies into the model as a random effect because it was important to observe how the estimates changed across increasingly aged subfamilies.

A p-value was calculated for each subfamily-specific regression equation and plotted as a function of the average millidiv in the entire subfamily within genes (figure \ref{fig:l1ageanova}). 79 of the 114 subfamilies had millidiv values that were significantly associated with location after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing ( $\alpha$  = 4.3e-04; Appendix table \ref{table:l1subvalues}). Moreover, the significance of these results increased with increasing age of the subfamily as a whole. These results indicated that there were different selection biases present depending on the placement of the RT.
    %Linear Regression Equation 1 : L1 anova
    \begin{equation}
    \label{l1anova}
         millidiv = \beta location_{subfamily, i}  +  \epsilon

To determine if the association between location and millidiv was effected more by regions within genes versus intergenic, or sense versus antisense.  77 subfamilies had elements that were significantly different in age between intergenic and within gene regions (tests =114 ; Bonferroni corrected $\alpha$ = 4.4e-04). 76 of these 77 subfamilies were older in intergenic regions than within genes. This substantiates the hypothesis that L1 retrotransposons undergo selection within genes, though indicates that there are varying effects contributing to the selection of L1 in genes. 10 subfamilies had significant differences in age between AS and S orientations, 7 of which were older in the antisense orientation.

\subsection{Purifying Selection of Alu within Genes}
Alu were similarly analyzed for differences in age depending on position and orientation. Similar to L1, there was an increasingly significant effect of Alu placement on age (figure \ref{fig:aluageanova}). 14 of the 14 subfamilies that were significantly different in age between intergenic and within genes had larger millidiv values intergenically (tests = 36 ; Bonferroni corrected  $\alpha$ = 1.4e-03) (Appendix table \ref{table:alusubvalues}). The trend of older Alu elements in intergenic regions indicated that Alu were commonly under a more negative selective force when within genes compared to the same subfamilies in intergenic regions. Similarly 20 of the 20 subfamilies that were significantly different in age between S and AS orientations were older in the AS orientation. This substantiates the hypothesis that S Alu undergo a more negative selective forces than AS Alu of the same subfamilies.

\subsection{The Ages of Alu and L1 are Dependent on the Chromosome of Origin}

The above results indicated that both Alu and L1 were undergoing selection within genes, though at different levels. To further test whether purifying selection or positive selection was acting on these RTs within genes, I took advantage of the differing rates of selection on chrX, chrY, and the autosomes. It's been shown previously that the ability for purifying selection of minorly deleterious alleles [??TRUE?] is reduced on chrY compared to chrX and the autosomes. Furthermore, there are varied effective population sizes between chrX, chrY, and the autosomes (section \ref{sec:selection}). Therefore, if selection is indeed acting on RTs within genes, elements should have different ages depending on the chromosome on which they reside. For this reason, and for the overall lack of purifying selection on chrY it was hypothesized that the age of RTs would be the lowest on chrX and the autosomes, while chrY would be expected to have older elements due to the lack of purifying selection.

To have a broad idea of the age of RTs across chromosomes, each placement group was analyzed with all subfamilies aggregated together. Although aggregating all subfamilies into a single measure was expected to wash out much of the signal, there were significant differences between chromosomes when analyzed this way (table \ref{table:chrxyage}).

\subsection{Evidence of Purifying Selection on S and AS Alu}

As expected, within sense Alu, elements on chrX had significantly lower millidiv than those on autosomes, which were significantly less than those on chrY (table \ref{table:chrsig}). The same pattern was identified between antisense Alu and between intergenic Alu. This result showed that chromosomes with heightened ability for purifying selection had elements that were significantly younger, supporting that purifying selection is indeed acting on Alu RTs. In fact, the effect of rate of selection as identified by type of chromosome had a larger effect on element age than the orientation. For example, sense Alu on chrY were significantly older than antisense Alu on autosomes, further indicating that the antisense bias is only present when purifying selection is present.

L1 elements in autosomes were clustered in one major branch and L1 elements on chrX were clustered on a second major branch (figure \ref{fig:hclustl1chr}). Interestingly, L1 on chrY were interspersed within chrX and autosomes. When compared to using Student's t-tests S L1 on chrY were significantly younger than AS L1 on chrY (table \ref{table:l1chrsig}), indicating a potential difference in selective force acting on S and AS L1 on chrY. Moreover, AS L1 on chrY were older on average than intergenic L1 on chrY. These effects are mimicked by the antisense ratios (table \ref{table:l1asbiaschr}), further implicating selection in the derivation of the altered distribution of RTs within genes.

\section{Conclusions}
In summary the results within this chapter indicate that the AS bias of Alu and L1 RTs is due to forces of selection. It was found that the AS bias that is present in the current human genome is not present upon integration, and that this bias is produced quickly over evolutionary time in Alu, and over longer periods of time for L1. The ages associated with these RTs further indicated that there are varied levels of selective pressures exerted on Alu and L1 depending on their position and orientation within the genome. In general, Alu and L1 within genes were younger than the same subfamilies intergenically. This was evidence that Alu and L1 may be under purifying selection within genes. Moreover, in regions with restricted purifying selection (i.e.:chrY), there was a reduction of both AS bias and an increase in age of Alu RTs. These results substantiate the hypothesis that RTs are initially integrated without bias but become non-randomly distributed over time due to selection. These findings warrant further study into the variables effecting the non-random distribution of RTs within genes to determine what variables associated with both RTs and with genes that effect the level of selection.
