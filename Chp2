    \paragraph{\large\textbf{Purpose\\}}
    \large{
The distribution of retrotransposons throughout the human genome shifted towards a non-uniform pattern over evolutionary time \cite{Lander2001,Moyzis1989, Ovchinnikov2001}. As mentioned previously, L1 elements are enriched within GC-poor regions, while Alu are commonly found in GC-rich regions \cite{Pavlicek2001, Soriano1983}. A second pattern of distribution emerges when analysis is restricted to gene regions. For example, previous studies have identified an increase of many families of retrotransposons near 5'\-UTRs \cite{Medstrand2002}. To distinguish whether this non-uniform distribution of retrotransposons within genes is a result of a bias during insertion, as opposed to an accumulation over time, we calculated the distribution of relatively recent Alu insertions within genes.

    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.1.1 } Recent Polymorphic Retrotransposons Have no Antisense Bias\\}}
    \large{
Since Alu insert at the highest rate in humans, these elements were examined to identify the insertion bias upon integration. L1 and SVA were not examined due low insertion rate, and therefore small sample sizes. Two samples of Alu were used for this analysis (a) Alu annotated as insertions in the \num{1000} genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}, and (b) Alu annotated as germline insertions \cite{Baillie2011}. Alu from group (a) were subdivided by population of origin (ie: Yoruban, YRI; European, CEU; Chinese/Japanese, CHBJPT). Alu that were population-specific were kept in the analysis, while Alu that were present among two or more populations were labelled as (c) shared, and were used in a future analysis. Group (a) and (b) were examined for proportion of antisense (AS) and sense (S) oriented Alu. The binomial test was used to calculate the deviation from the null hypothesis that AS and S oriented Alu occur in equal amounts in newly inserted Alu. Alu counts from YRI, CEU, CHBJPT, and group (b) were combined to reduce type II error by increasing sample size. With the total sample size of \num{735}, the computed required effect size was \num{-0.43}. The counts of AS and S Alu were not significantly different from one another (probability of AS = \num{0.49}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.46} - \num{0.53}; p = \num{0.94}).

Although these newly inserted Alu did not have a significant AS bias, it is possible that they have a bias that is similar to the often cited AS bias in the Hg19 reference genome [REFs]. The AS bias in the Hg19 reference is significantly different from the null hypothesis of equal distribution (probability of AS = 0.55 ; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.548} - \num{0.550}; p < \num{2.47}e-\num{323}). This proportion of AS is significantly different from that of relatively new inserts (\num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.09} - \num{-0.01}; p < \num{0.006}). These results indicate that contrary to older Alu, newly inserted Alu have no detectable antisense bias.

%TPRT
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.1.2 } AS bias of TPRT and non-TPRT integrated transposons\\}}
    \large{
Alu, L1, and SVA are all integrated through the process of target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). Therefore to test if TPRT is responsible for AS bias, we examined the null hypothesis that transposons inserted by non-TPRT mechanisms had equal proportions of sense and antisense elements. Similar to Alu, a pooled group of DNA transposons had a significant increase of AS elements over S elements (probability of AS = \num{0.540}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.538} - \num{0.543}; p < \num{1.64}e\num{-190}), indicating that AS bias is not restricted to elements integrated by TPRT.

%AS bias changes over evolutionary time
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\num{2.2 } Antisense Bias Increases Over Evolutionary Time}}
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.2.1 } Antisense bias of Alu increases between segregating and fixed alleles\\}}
    \large{
Since we have shown that Alu present in the reference genome have a significantly larger proportion of AS elements than newly integrated elements, it is likely that this change in proportion is due to an action over time. The other possibility would be due to a change in the mechanism of integration between older elements and younger elements, though the results from non-TPRT integration, and from [what?], make this hypothesis less likely. To examine the change of AS proportion in Alu we compared the proportion of Alu within segregating and fixed Alu. Segregating Alu were seperated into two groups \num{1}.) Population-specific Alu from the 1000 genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}, and \num{2}.) Alu shared among all populations in the 1000 genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}. Fixed Alu were also derived from two groups: \num{3}.) Human-specific Alu \cite{Bennett2008}, and \num{4}.) Hg19 Reference Alu \cite{Kent2002}. The mean allele frequencies of groups (1) and (2) are [x] and \num{0.24} respectively. Groups \num{3} and \num{4} are expected to have allele frequencies centered around 1. When all groups were ordered by rank, there was an increase in probability of AS within increasing rank (figure \ref{fig:pAS}), indicating a tendency towards an increase in p(AS) with increasing residence time in the genome.

\paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.2.2 } Antisense bias of Alu is constant across Reference Subfamilies\\}}
To further examine the change of pAS over time we subset Alu and L1 into subfamilies. Elements within a subfamily have similar residence times in the genome. The relative age of a subfamily is often measured as the average distance of all elements within a subfamily from the respective consensus sequence (milliDiv). AS bias was compared across Alu subfamilies under AluY and AluS. AluJ was analyzed seperately due to [bla blibbidy bla]. There was a slight increase in AS bias with increasing millidiv, though, this increase was not signficant (F-test p = \num{0.63}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_subfam}). These results indicate that Alu are initially integrated with no AS bias, AS and S Alu are then differentially maintained setting up the reference AS bias. And this event occurs relatively quickly on evolutionary time scales, (ie: prior to fixation).

\paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.2.3 } Antisense bias of L1 Increases Across Reference Subfamilies\\}}
L1 are present in high enough numbers in the reference genome to be analyzed for AS bias across subfamilies. The combined Hg19 reference L1 AS bias is significantly different from 50:50 (probability of AS = \num{0.656}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.654} - \num{0.657}; p < \num{1.98}e{-323}). The AS bias of L1 is larger than that of Alu. Furthermore, contrary to the results from Alu, L1 exhibit a significant association between AS bias and relative age as measured by millidiv (F-test p < \num{2.66}e{-06}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_l1}).

%Signs of purifying selection
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\num{2.3 } Purifying Selection on Retrotransposons in Genes}}
    \large{
The results so far have shown that AS bias increases over time, with Alu increasing relatively quickly and L1 continuing to increase over larger periods of time. If selection within genes is playing a role in this change in AS bias, there are three models to examine. 1.) Antisense RTs undergo positive selection within genes, 2.) Sense RTs undergo negative selection within genes, 3.) Both (1) and (2) are true. Previous reports have indicated that on a genome-wide level, Alu undergo purifying selection \cite{Stewart2011}, though [REF] has proposed that RTs are under positive selection within genes. 
    }
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.3.1 }Purifying selection of retrotransposons in genes\\}}
    \large{
To examine the influence of positive or purifying selection on Alu we took advantage of the fact that the  more deleterious an allele is, the younger it is \cite{Kimura1969,Li1975}. [Explain this in clear language]. RTs within the same subfamily were assumed to have inserted at relatively equivalent time scales. Millidivs from the subfamily consensus were then measured for each orientation. Therefore the age in millidiv of AS were compared only to their S counterparts within the same subfamily. The null expactation being that AS and S RTs of the same subfamily are of equivalent ages. The mean Student's t test statistic of the differences between S and AS Alu was \num{-3.28}, with a majority of the tests being highly significant (figure \ref{fig:age_alu}). The mean test statistic for L1 was similarly less than \num{1} (-0.38), though the effect of orientation on age was much smaller with a majority of the tests spanning zero (figure \ref{fig:age_l1}). 

    %Figure Age of Alu
    \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{age_alu.pdf}
        \caption{Sense oriented Alu are Younger than Antisense}
        \label{fig:age_alu}
    \end{figure}
    
    %Figure Age of L1
    \begin{figure}[!h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{age_l1.pdf}
        \caption{Sense oriented L1 are Younger than Antisense}
        \label{fig:age_l1}
    \end{figure}

If however, AS are positively selected they will be older than S, while if S are purified, then S will be younger than AS. There is an obvious paradox(?) in this setup. That is that, when AS is compared versus S we can only determine that they are different in age from one another. To determine the direction of difference, we need a reference point to compare to. In this case we chose to compare to intergenic rates of mutation, under the null hypothesis that intergenic RTs are under equivalent rates of selection in either orientation, and that these rates approximate neutral. By comparing RT ages in genes to those intergenically, we can now determine whether AS are increased versus intergenic or S are decreased versus intergenic. And the difference between AS and S.
