    \large{
It is possible that the distribution of RTs is a direct effect of selection on RTs, and is therefore indicative of the local effect of RTs on genes. For example, low RT density would indicate regions sensitive to RTs, thus natural selection purifies them from those regions (i.e: near exons \ref{Zhang2011}). Similarly high density regions would indicate either a neutral or positive response to a RT insertion. One of the published patterns of distribution is the tendency of RTs to be present in the antisense (AS) orientation within genes more often than the sense (S) orientation. This has been termed the antisense bias (AS bias). An interesting feature of this bias is that it peaks near the transcription start site \ref{Medstrand2002}. It is possible that this altered distribution is due to natural selection acting differently on the same RT in different orientations. If this is true, then the AS bias can be used to measure regional sensitivities to RT insertions. However possible, there is also another potential cause of this bias that must be ruled out, and that is that the AS-bias does not accumulate over time through selection, but during the integration process. To distinguish whether AS bias is a result of integration or selection over time, the distribution of relatively recent Alu insertions were examined, as well as the change in AS bias over evolutionary time.

    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.1.2 } Young AS and S Alu are Present in Equal Proportions \\}}
    \large{
Alu insert at a higher rate than either L1 or SVA, and have a larger sample size of elements with low residence times in the population. These recently integrated Alu were examined to identify the AS bias upon integration. Two samples of relatively young Alu were used for this analysis (a) Alu annotated as insertions in the \num{1000} genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}, and (b) Alu annotated as germline insertions \cite{Baillie2011}. Alu from group (a) are all elements that are polymorphic in the population studied. Three population groups were used in this 1000 genomes study; Yoruban, YRI; European, CEU; and Chinese/Japanese, CHBJPT. Alu that were population-specific were kept in the analysis, while Alu that were present among two or more populations were labelled as (c) shared, and were used in a future analysis. The mean allele frequency of Alu presence was 0.49,0.59, and 0.54 in YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT respectively. Group (b) elements were derived from three individuals that were examined for non-reference Alu insertions in various somatic tissues. The insertions that were deemed 'germline' insertions by comparison between multiple tissues were used for this analysis.

Group (a) and (b) were examined for proportion of AS and S oriented Alu. The binomial test was used to calculate the deviation from the null hypothesis that AS and S oriented Alu occur in equal proportions. Alu counts from YRI, CEU, CHBJPT, and group (b) were combined to reduce type II error by increasing sample size. With the total sample size of \num{735}, the computed required effect size was \num{-0.43}. The counts of AS and S Alu were not significantly different from one another (probability of AS = \num{0.49}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.46} - \num{0.53}; p = \num{0.94}), indicating that a significant AS bias was not present in these newly inserted Alu.

Since the null hypothesis can not be proven, only disproven, the converse hypothesis was tested. This hypothesis was that the AS bias of newly inserted Alu was equal to the AS bias of the reference set of Alu (Hg19). The reference set was chosen as the comparison since this was the group of Alu from within which the AS bias was originally identified. As has been previously documented, the proportions of AS and S Alu in the Hg19 reference was significantly different from the null hypothesis of equal distribution (probability of AS = 0.55 ; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.548} - \num{0.550}; p < \num{2.47}e-\num{323}). When the AS bias of reference Alu was compared to new inserts, it was identified that reference Alu had a significantly different AS bias than newly inserted Alu (\num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.09} - \num{-0.01}; p < \num{0.006}). These results indicate that contrary to older Alu, newly inserted Alu have no detectable antisense bias.

%TPRT
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.1.3 } AS bias is present in transposons integrated by non-TPRT mechanisms\\}}
    \large{
The overarching goal of this chapter was to discriminate between the RT integration process and selection over time, as being responsible for AS bias. It has just been shown that there is no discernable AS bias upon integration, indiciating that the process of Alu integration (ie: TPRT) does not likely contribute to AS bias. Alu, L1, and SVA are all integrated through the process of TPRT, and all have significant differences in the proportion of AS and S elements. Therefore, it is pertinent to this study to determine if AS bias is restricted to elements which are integrated by TPRT. The null hypothesis that transposons inserted by non-TPRT mechanisms had equal proportions of sense and antisense elements was examined. Similar to Alu, a pooled group of DNA transposons had a significant increase of AS elements over S elements (probability of AS = \num{0.540}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.538} - \num{0.543}; p < \num{1.64}e\num{-190}), indicating that AS bias is not restricted to the RT-specific form of integration, TPRT.

%AS bias changes over evolutionary time
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\num{2.2 } Antisense Bias Increases Over Evolutionary Time}}
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{Purpose\\}}
    \large{
Since Alu present in the reference genome have a significantly larger proportion of AS elements than newly integrated elements, it is likely that this change in proportion was due to a progressive action over time. It is important to examine the change in AS bias over time, since a change over time is indicative of selection acting on the elements depending on the orientation within a gene. The fact that RTs can have a selectable effect on genes depending on their orientation would then allow us to study the effects that RTs are having on genes.

 \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.2.1 } Antisense bias of Alu is Constant across Reference Subfamilies\\}}
To examine the change of pAS over time we subset Alu and L1 into their predefined subfamilies. Elements within a subfamily have similar residence times in the genome. The relative age of a subfamily is often measured as the average distance of all elements within a subfamily from the respective consensus sequence (milliDiv). AS bias was compared across Alu subfamilies under AluY and AluS. AluJ was analyzed seperately due to [bla blibbidy bla]. There was a slight increase in AS bias with increasing millidiv, though, this increase was not signficant (F-test p = \num{0.63}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_subfam}). These results indicate that Alu are initially integrated with no AS bias, AS and S Alu are then differentially maintained setting up the reference AS bias. And this event occurs relatively quickly on evolutionary time scales, (ie: prior to fixation).

    \large{
To examine the change of AS proportion in Alu we compared the proportion of Alu within segregating and fixed Alu. Segregating Alu were seperated into two groups \num{1}.) Population-specific Alu from the 1000 genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}, and \num{2}.) Alu shared among all populations in the 1000 genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}. Fixed Alu were also derived from two groups: \num{3}.) Human-specific Alu \cite{Bennett2008}, and \num{4}.) Hg19 Reference Alu \cite{Kent2002}. The mean allele frequencies of groups (1) and (2) are [x] and \num{0.24} respectively. Groups \num{3} and \num{4} are expected to have allele frequencies centered around 1. When all groups were ordered by rank, there was an increase in probability of AS within increasing rank (figure \ref{fig:pAS}), indicating a tendency towards an increase in p(AS) with increasing residence time in the genome.

\paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.2.3 } Antisense bias of L1 Increases Across Reference Subfamilies\\}}
L1 are present in high enough numbers in the reference genome to be analyzed for AS bias across subfamilies. The combined Hg19 reference L1 AS bias is significantly different from 50:50 (probability of AS = \num{0.656}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.654} - \num{0.657}; p < \num{1.98}e{-323}). The AS bias of L1 is larger than that of Alu. Furthermore, contrary to the results from Alu, L1 exhibit a significant association between AS bias and relative age as measured by millidiv (F-test p < \num{2.66}e{-06}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_l1}).

%Signs of purifying selection
    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\num{2.3 } Differences in Selection Between S and AS RTs}}
    \large{
The results so far have shown that AS bias increases over time, with Alu increasing relatively quickly and L1 continuing to increase over larger periods of time. If selection within genes is playing a role in this change in AS bias, there are three models to examine. 1.) Antisense RTs undergo positive selection within genes, 2.) Sense RTs undergo negative selection within genes, 3.) Both (1) and (2) are true. Previous reports have indicated that on a genome-wide level, Alu undergo purifying selection \cite{Stewart2011}, though [REF] has proposed that RTs are under positive selection within genes.

In 1975 Li calculated that on average, deleterious alleles will have shorter residence times in the population. In other words, they will be younger than neutral or advantageous alleles \cite{Li1975}. The logic behind this finding lies in that, in populations of equal size, an allele is more likely to be passed on to the next generation if it is neutral or positive compared to an allele that is deleterious. The neutral or positive allele will therefore remain in the population longer, accumulating a longer residence time in the genome. Meanwhile, new alleles, both advantageous and deleterious will continually appear. While the advantageous alleles are retained, the deleterious alleles will continually be lost, with only young alleles that have replaced them remaining present. Therefore at any discrete point in time, the delterious alleles will be younger on average than the advantageous alleles.

    \paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.3.1 }Purifying selection of retrotransposons in genes\\}}
    \large{
Using the rationale presented in Li, 1975; the relative force of selection can be compared between two, otherwise equal, alleles by calculating their respective residence times in a population. RTs within a subfamily are defined by the fact that they amplified at similar points in time [REF]. Therefore, barring any forces of selection, the mean ages of AS and S RTs of the same subfamily should be equivalent.

Estimates of the expected effect that differing rates of selection have on the cummulative age of the RT were determined through simulations. For the simulation, a genome was constructed that lacked any RT. For each generation, x new RTs were integrated. These RTs then survived on to the next generation with probability, p$_{\text{AS}}$ for AS RTs, and p$_{\text{S}}$ for S RTs. RTs that sucessfully passed to the next generation were then marked as one generation older.Since, Alu and L1 show different rates of change in AS bias, the simulations were run with two different models. The first model (constant) was similar to what was seen in L1; where AS bias changed constantly over time. The assumption here was that the constant change in AS bias was due to a constant low-level selection acting on L1. The second model (immediate) was similar to what was seen for Alu; where the AS bias changed quickly over time and then remained constant. The assumption was that selection acted on the RT quickly, and then the element reached fixation in the population and would not be lost.

The results from the constant simulations show that with an increasing difference between [p(gen) AS / p(gen) S] (ratio) there was an increase in the age difference between a and b. Similarly, there was an increase difference between a and b in the immediate simulations, however the difference was smaller at similar ratios. Interestingly, the AS bias is not dependent on the simulation type, or therefore the age difference.

The age of AS and S Alu were calculated as millidiv from the respective consensus sequence. The mean ages of AS and S Alu were compared within each subfamily using a Student's t-test. Most elements were significantly younger in the S orientation when compared to elements of the same family in the AS direction, with a mean test statistic of \num{-3.28} (figure \ref{fig:age_alu}).

Conversely, the mean test statistic for L1 was -0.38, and the effect of orientation on age was much smaller with a majority of the test statistics spanning zero (figure \ref{fig:age_l1}).

\paragraph{\large\textbf{\textnormal{2.3.2 }Purifying selection of RTs in genes\\}}
\large{
At this point we have shown that Alu in the S orientation are significantly younger than Alu in the AS orientation. L1, however, show a mixed effect, with some subfamilies having a significant difference in age between S and AS, though this is true in both directions. Meaning sometimes S is younger and sometimes AS is younger.

From this analysis the difference in selection between AS and S is known, however the direction of selection remains unknown. Meaning, the results are ambiguous to knowing whether S are younger than AS because S are undergoing negative selection, or because AS are undergoing positive selection. To determine the direction of selection, intergenic RTs were used as a reference point. When compared to intergenic Alu of the same subfamily, Alu in genes were younger in age (figure \ref{fig:age_alu_rel}). S Alu were also reduced in age compared to AS Alu within the older subfamilies (AluJ: Student's t-test p < 1.5e-04; AluS: Student's t-test p < 1.3e-03; AluY: Student's t-test p = 0.73). This supports the hypothesis that Alu undergo purifying selection within genes with Alu in the S orientation being purified to a stronger degree than AS.

        \label{fig:age_alu_rel_int}
    \end{figure}

Similarly, there was a noted decrease in the age of L1 in genes compared to intergenic. This indicates that purifying selection was acting more on L1 in genes than intergenically. Alternatively to Alu, AS and S L1 were similar in age (L1M: Student's t-test p = 0.32; L1P: Student's t-test p = 0.65).
