\chapter{\\ORIGINS OF THE RETROTRANSPOSON ANTISENSE BIAS}
\doublespace\large{

The phenomenon of non-randomly distributed RTs facilitates studies into the variable effects that RTs impart on genes. Effects that may be accompanied by phenotypic changes. This is only true, however, if the altered distribution of RTs within genes is due to forces acting on phenotypes (i.e.: selection) as opposed to other mechanisms such as genetic drift or RT mobilization. Studies attempting to determine the mechanistic underpinnings leading to changes in RT distribution over time have identified that selection is indeed the major mechanism responsible [REFs, and \ref{sec:dist}].

Despite the knowledge that some form of selection acts on RTs in general, there are two major questions that are yet to be resolved, i) is the altered distribution of RTs, specifically within genes, due to selection? and ii) are the selective forces acting on RTs positive or negative (purifying)? Although the first question (i) may seem like an unnecessary detail to pursue, it is vital to future studies attempting to discern the phenotypic effects of RTs on genes. It is important because there are altered distributions of RTs within genes that, if they are due to selection, can be used to predict the phenotypic impact of future insertions. If instead the altered distribution of RTs in genes is due to integration, then these predictions would be unfounded, and perhaps misleading. Though it is unlikely, it is possible that the altered distributions within genes are due to integration bias. This distinction must be determined before further analyses on phenotypic associations with RTs distributions are analyzed.

The RT antisense bias (AS bias) is a powerful example of altered distributions of RTs within genes that can be used to delineate between effects of selection versus integration. AS bias is the tendency of RTs to be present in the antisense (AS) orientation within genes more often than the sense (S) orientation. An interesting feature of AS bias is that it peaks near transcription start sites (TSS), as do the total number of RTs \cite{Medstrand2002}.

This recurring altered distribution of AS bias towards transcription start sites may indicate an mechanism of selection, however it may also indicate a preference for integration locations. An argument for the enrichment of  RTs  near the TSS is that there is increased open chromatin near the TSS and therefore increased accesibility to the L1 ORF2p endonuclease [REF]. However, if open chromatin was the reason for the increase in RTs then this preference should be replicated in both the sense and antisense orientations. Moreover, since L1 ORF2p endonucleases bind dsDNA, there should be no preference for integration due to single-strand accesibility [REF]. Also, it has been shown that RTs in the sense orientation effect transcription of the coincident gene, while RTs in the antisense orientation have little to no effect [REFs]. For these reasons, it was hypothesized that the AS bias of RTs in genes was due to selection.   

To distinguish whether AS bias was truly a result of    selection over time or if it was due to integration, the distribution of relatively recent Alu insertions were examined, as well as the change in AS bias over evolutionary time.

\section{Retrotransposon Antisense Bias and the Process of Integration}
\subsection{Young AS and S Alu are Present in Equal Proportions}
\label{sec:youngas}
Newly inserted RTs should be equally represented in the sense (S) and antisense (AS) orientations if selection is the driving force of AS bias in genes. Alu and L1 insert at a higher rate than SVA, and therefore have a larger sample size of elements with low residence times in the population (i.e.: young). For this reason, Alu and L1 were studied to examine the AS bias of newly inserted elements. 

Two samples of young RTs (Alu and L1) were used for this analysis (\textit{a} and \textit{b}) filtered groups of Alu that were annotated as insertions in the \num{1000} genomes project \cite{Stewart2011}, and (\textit{c}) Alu and L1 annotated as newly identified germline insertions \cite{Baillie2011, Bundo2013}. Both groups represent RTs that are polymorphic with relatively small residence times in the population. Here, polymorphic refers to presence or absence of the entire element where any mutations within the element are irrelevant. 

Alu in groups \textit{a} and \textit{b} were initially identified in the 1000 genomes project as being polymorphic between individuals \cite{Stewart2011}. The allele frequencies of these elements were calculated from three populations; Yoruban (YRI); European (CEU); and Chinese/Japanese (CHBJPT) \cite{Stewart2011}. For the current analysis, 1000 genomes annoted Alu were separated into two groups: \textit{a}) population-specific Alu (i.e.: Allele Frequency (AF) > 0 in only one population), and \textit{b}) Alu present among two or more populations. Group \textit{c} elements were derived from three individuals that were examined for non-reference Alu insertions in various somatic tissues. The mean AFs of group \textit{a} Alu were 0.091 ($\pm$0.071), 0.067 ($\pm$0.047), and 0.070 ($\pm$0.067) in YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT respectively. To identify the mean AF of group \textit{b} Alu, the maximum population-specific AF was identified per element. The average of these maximum AFs was significantly higher than the population-specific sets 0.279($\pm$0.16) (Wilcoxon rank sum p$_{, YRI}$ < 1.3e-184; p$_{, CEU}$ < 2.6e-62; p$_{, CHBJPT}$ < 8.5e-49). The AFs of group \textit{c} Alu were similar in all three populations (figure \ref{fig:AF_3d}). Since AFs are correlated with residence times in the population \cite{Li1975}, these AFs indicate that group \textit{a} Alu have shorter residence times (younger) than group \textit{b}.

    \end{figure}
    
Although the allele frequencies of group \textit{c} RTs were unknown, they were identified in Baillie et. al. as being present in the germline insertions. Since group \textit{a} and \textit{c} RTs all represent young polymorphic insertions the counts were combined across all groups to reduce type II error by increasing sample size (table \ref{table:youngasbias}). The probability of choosing an AS RT in this combined group was tested versus an expected probability of 0.50 using the binomial sign test. The hypothesis that young insertions had an AS bias equal to 0.50 could not be rejected (p(AS) = 0.50 ; \num{95}\% CI = 0.47 -- 0.53; p = 0.84). It was noted, that there may have been a bias imparted to the calculation by combining both group \text{a} and \textit{c} RTs. Group \textit{a} RTs were therefore tested separately, despite a reduction in power, and also  did not have a p(AS) significantly different from 0.5 (p(AS) = 0.53; \num{95}\% CI = 0.48 -- 0.57; p = 0.20). Although the results of insignificance indicated that young RTs may not have an AS bias, the null hypothesis can not be proved, only rejected \cite{Popper1959,Wilckinson2013}. Therefore, young RTs were tested against the AS bias of the reference RTs, to determine if the AS bias of young elements was significantly different from the bias that is often cited in the literature \cite{Zhang2011}.

The proportion of AS elements in the young group of Alu and L1 were compared versus the antisense bias of reference Alu and L1. As has been previously documented, the proportions of AS and S Alu and L1 in the Hg19 reference were significantly different from the null hypothesis of equal distribution (table \ref{table:alul1ref}). A test of equal proportions was used to calculate the deviation from the null hypothesis that young AS RTs occur in equal proportion to that of reference RTs. It was identified that reference Alu and L1 RTs had a significantly different AS bias than newly inserted Alu (proportion AS$_{young}$ = 0.50; proportion AS$_{Ref}$ = 0.59; \num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.12} - \num{-0.057}; p < \num{4.44}e-09). This is evidence that the commonly cited AS bias of reference Alu is not present initially upon integration.

%TPRT
\subsection{AS bias is present in transposons integrated by non-TPRT mechanisms}

The evidence presented in section \ref{sec:youngas} has shown that there is no discernible AS bias upon integration, indicating that the process of Alu integration (ie: TPRT) does not likely contribute to AS bias. Alu, L1, and SVA are all integrated through the process of TPRT, and all have significant differences in the proportion of AS and S elements. Therefore, it is pertinent to this study to determine if AS bias is restricted to elements which are integrated by TPRT. The null hypothesis that transposons inserted by non-TPRT mechanisms had equal proportions of sense and antisense elements was examined. Similar to Alu, a pooled group of DNA transposons had a significant increase of AS elements over S elements (probability of AS = \num{0.540}; \num{95}\% CI = \num{0.538} - \num{0.543}; p < \num{1.64}e\num{-190}), indicating that AS bias is not restricted to the RT-specific form of integration, TPRT.

%AS bias changes over evolutionary time
\section{Antisense Bias Increases Over Evolutionary Time}
Since Alu present in the reference genome have a significantly larger proportion of AS elements than newly integrated elements, it is likely that this change in proportion was due to a progressive action over time. It is therefore important to examine the change in AS bias over time.

        \label{fig:pAS_subfam}
    \end{figure}
    
\subsection{Antisense bias of Alu is Constant across Reference Subfamilies}
To examine the change of p(AS) over time, AS bias of Alu and L1 were individually examined after separation into their predefined subfamilies. The relative age of a subfamily is often measured as the average distance of all elements within a subfamily from the respective consensus sequence (milliDiv). Elements within a subfamily have similar residence times in the genome [REFs].  Millidiv was therefore used as a measurement of time where smaller values of millidiv corresponded to younger elements with less residence time in the population, and larger millidiv corresponded to older elements with longer residence times. AS bias was examined across Alu subfamilies ranked by millidiv (figure \ref{fig:pAS_subfam}). There was a slight increase in AS bias with increasing millidiv, though, this increase was not signficant (slope: 4.1e-04; F-test p = \num{0.38}). 

\subsection{Antisense bias of L1 Increases Across Reference Subfamilies}

    %Figure pAS_subfamily L1
    \begin{figure}[!ht]

        \caption{\normalsize{\textbf{Change in pAS Across Reference L1\\}AS/S ratios were calculated for each L1 subfamily and plotted versus the mean deviation from the subfamily consensus sequence (millidiv).

        \label{fig:pAS_l1_2}
    \end{figure}
    
Although Alu and L1 both have a signficant AS bias in the genome, it is possible that they are undergoing different degrees of selection. As pol-II promoted transcripts, L1 have the potential to disrupt expression more substantially than Alu [REF]. L1 have also been evolving since before the split of  marsupials and eutherians, as opposed to Alu which have only been present in the primate lineages, therefore the extent of time that is covered by the L1 subfamilies is effectively longer than that of Alu [REFs]. For these reasons, it is more likely to observe a change in AS bias in L1 as opposed to Alu. This is evidenced by the finding that the AS bias of L1 is significantly larger than that of Alu (prop AS$_{L1}$ =  0.656; prop AS$_{Alu}$ = 0.549 ; p < 2.2e-16).

L1 AS bias was examined across subfamilies ordered by millidiv. Contrary to the findings in Alu, there was a significant trend towards an increase in AS bias over time (F-test p < \num{2.66}e{-06}) (figure \ref{fig:pAS_l1_2}). These results indicate that, as opposed to a static property of the integration, AS bias increases dynamically over time. 

 
\subsection{Antisense bias of Alu increases quickly over evolutionary time}
The findings so far have shown that AS and S RTs have no bias upon integration, however there is an AS bias of Alu in the reference genome. For Alu, this AS bias in reference Alu was independent of the age of the subfamily. It was therefore hypothesized that AS bias in Alu was achieved rapidly after integration.  To examine the change of AS proportion on shorter time scales than the previous analysis, p(AS) of young Alu were compared to p(AS) of Alu that were shared among all three populations (group \textit{b}). Shared Alu were assumed to have longer residence times in the genome than young Alu because shared elements must have integrated prior to the split of YRI, CEU, and CHBJPT, while young elements were assumed to have inserted after the split. The higher average allele frequencies of shared Alu compared to group population-specific Alu substantiates this assumption (section \ref{sec:youngas}). Although the shared Alu had a mean frequency of 0.28, there were elements with allele frequencies of 1 within a specific population (figure \ref{fig:shared_freq}). The proportion of AS in the young subset of Alu was significantly smaller than polymorphic Alu that were shared among all three populations ($propAS_{\text{young}}$ = 0.48; $propAS_{\text{shared}}$ = 0.54; \num{95}\% CI = \num{-0.11} - \num{-0.02}; p < \num{0.01}). This indicates that the change to AS bias of Alu occured quickly over evolutionary time.

    %Figure pAS

        \label{fig:shared_freq}
    \end{figure}


These results indicate that Alu are initially integrated with no AS bias, AS and S Alu are then differentially maintained setting up the reference AS bias. And this event occurs relatively quickly on evolutionary time scales (ie: prior to fixation). It must be noted that this same hypothesis could be true for L1 as well, though there are not enough counts of shared L1 to test this hypothesis.


%Signs of purifying selection
\section{Evidence of Purifying Selection on S and AS Retrotransposons}
The results so far have shown that AS bias is not present upon integration but increases over time, as would be expected under a model of selection. If selection within genes is playing a role in this change in AS bias, there are three working hypotheses that can be tested: \textit{1}) Antisense RTs undergo positive selection within genes, \textit{2}) Sense RTs undergo negative (purifying) selection within genes, and \textit{3}) Both (\textit{1}) and (\textit{2}) are true. Previous reports have indicated that Alu undergo purifying selection on a genome-wide level \cite{Stewart2011}. However, Lander et al. have proposed that the increase of Alu in GC-rich regions was due to positive selection, though gave no experimental evidence to support these conclusions \cite{Lander2001}. Neither of these studies have addressed the selection of RTs within gene boundaries, which is important to study due to the potential distruptions of RTs directly on transcription as well as regulation of both transcription and translation [REFs].

In 1975 Li calculated that on average, deleterious alleles have shorter residence times in a population. In other words, they will be younger than neutral or advantageous alleles \cite{Li1975}. The logic behind this finding lies in that, in populations of equal size, an allele is more likely to be passed on to the next generation if it is neutral or positive compared to an allele that is deleterious. The neutral or positive allele will therefore remain in the population longer, accumulating a longer residence time in the genome. Meanwhile, new alleles, both advantageous and deleterious will continually appear. While the advantageous alleles are retained, the deleterious alleles will continually be lost, with only young alleles that have replaced them remaining present. Therefore at any discrete point in time, the deleterious alleles will be younger on average than the advantageous or neutral alleles.

         %Figure 
    \begin{figure}[!ht]

        \label{fig:l1age}
    \end{figure}

Using the rationale presented in Li, 1975; the relative force of selection can be compared between two, otherwise equal, alleles by calculating their respective residence times in a population. RTs within a subfamily are an optimal sample to study selective forces, since they have the advantage of being amplified at similar points in time [REF]. Therefore, elements of the same subfamily should have similar residence times in the population when calculated as millidiv. However, if there are deviations in the forces of selection between subsets of the subfamily (i.e: AS versus S) , then the residence times in the population should be unequal. An example of the hypothesis is presented in figure \ref{fig:l1age}. Here is shown the AS bias of Alu in two regions of genes, one region with a large AS bias, and one region with no AS bias. The hypotheses of selection underlying these distributions are listed at the bottom of the figure. 


\subsection{Purifying selection of RTs in genes}
Since Alu and L1 showed different changes in AS bias over time, it was expected that the age ranges associated with differences in AS bias would also be different. It was expected that despite the apparent AS bias, Alu would have relatively similar ages between AS and S elements, since they likely were selected on relatively soon after integration.

         %Figure 
    \begin{figure}[!ht]

        \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth,natwidth=610,natheight=642]{l1_age_anova.pdf}

        }
        \label{fig:l1ageanova}
    \end{figure}

It was important to determine if the age of an L1 element was contingent on the placement within the genome (i.e.: intergenic, AS within genes, or S within genes). To examine the associated of age with placement, millidiv was regressed on dummy variables representing each possible placement of the element (equation \ref{l1anova}). Since each subfamily has a different mean millidiv, and therefore would contribute differently to the calculation irrespective of placement, separate equations were calculated for each subfamily. This method of analysing the subfamilies separately was chosen instead of adding the subfamilies into the model as a random effect because it was important to observe how the estimates changed across increasingly aged subfamilies. A p-value was calculated for each regression equation and plotted as a function of the average millidiv in the entire subfamily within genes (figure \ref{fig:l1ageanova}). 79 of the 114 subfamilies had millidiv values that were significantly associated with location after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing ( $\alpha$  = 4.3e-04; Appendix table \ref{table:l1subvalues}). Moreover, the significance of these results increased with increasing age of the subfamily as a whole. These results indicated that there were different selection biases present depending on the placement of the RT.

To determine if the association between location and millidiv was effected more by regions within genes versus intergenic, or sense versus antisense.  77 subfamilies had elements that were significantly different in age between intergenic and within gene regions (tests =114 ; Bonferroni corrected $\alpha$ = 4.4e-04). 76 of these 77 subfamilies were older in intergenic regions than within genes. This substantiates the hypothesis that L1 retrotransposons undergo purifying selection within genes. 10 subfamilies had significant differences in age between AS and S orientations, 7 of which were older in the antisense orientation.

Alu were similarly analyzed for differences in age depending on position and orientation. Similar to L1, there was an increasingly significant effect of difference in age between regions within increasing age of the subfamily (figure \ref{fig:aluageanova}). Interestingly 14 of the 14 subfamilies that were significantly different in age between intergenic and within genes were all older intergenically (tests = 36 ; Bonferroni corrected  $\alpha$ = 1.4e-03). This replicates the findings from L1 showing that both L1 and Alu are under purifying selection in genes when compared to the same subfamilies in intergenic regions. Similarly 20 of the 20 subfamilies that were significantly different in age between S and AS orientations were older in the AS orientation.

\subsection{Lack of Purifying Selection of RTs on ChrY}
To further test whether purifying or positive selection were acting on RTs within genes, we took advantage of the differing rates of selection on chrX, chrY, and the autosomes. It's been shown previously that rates of selection are faster on chrX than the autosomes, and faster on the autosomes than chrY [REF]. For this reason, and for the overall lack of purifying selection on chrY it was hypothesized that the age of RTs would increase in age from chrX to autosomes to chrY, within groups of RTs. First, to have a broad idea of the age of RTs across chromosomes, each location group was analyzed with all subfamilies aggregated together. Although aggregating all subfamilies into a single measure was expected to wash out a lot of the signal, there were significant differences between chromosomes when analyzed this way (table \ref{table:chrxyage}).

As expected, within sense Alu, elements on chrX had significantly lower millidiv than those on autosomes, which were significantly less than those on chrY (table \ref{table:chrsig}). The same pattern was identified between antisense Alu and between intergenic Alu. This result showed that chromosomes with heightened ability for purifying selection had elements that were significantly younger, supporting that purifying selection is indeed acting on Alu RTs. In fact, the effect of rate of selection as identified by type of chromosome had a larger effect on element age than the orientation. For example, sense Alu on chrY were significantly older than antisense Alu on autosomes, further indicating that the antisense bias is only present when purifying selection is present.
